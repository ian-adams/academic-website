      "abstract": "Abstract Research summary Several of the largest U.S. police departments reported a sharp increase in officer resignations following massive public protests directed at policing in the summer of 2020. Yet, to date, no study has rigorously assessed the impact of the George Floyd protests on police resignations. We fill this void using 60 months of employment data from a large police department in the western United States. Bayesian structural time‐series modeling shows that voluntary resignations increased by 279% relative to the synthetic control, and the model predicts that resignations will continue at an elevated level. However, retirements and involuntary separations were not significantly affected during the study period. Policy implications A retention crisis may diminish police departments’ operational capacity to carry out their expected responsibilities. Criminal justice stakeholders must be prepared to confront workforce decline and increased voluntary turnover. Proactive efforts to improve organizational justice for sworn personnel can moderate officer perceptions of public hostility.",

      "llm_synopsis": "Police officers quit their jobs at nearly three times the normal rate following the widespread protests after George Floyd's death in 2020, according to a study that tracked employment data from a large police department over five years. While retirements and firings remained steady, voluntary resignations spiked by 279% and are predicted to stay high, creating a staffing crisis that could affect departments' ability to respond to crime and serve communities. This finding suggests that periods of intense public scrutiny and criticism can trigger significant workforce losses in policing, forcing police leaders to find new ways to retain officers and maintain public safety operations.",

      "abstract": "Police departments in the United States are rapidly adopting body-worn cameras (BWCs). To date, no study has investigated the effects of BWCs on police officers themselves, despite evidence suggesting negative effects of electronic performance monitoring on employee well-being. Police officers already experience higher levels of burnout than other professions. We hypothesize that the intense surveillance of BWCs will manifest in how police officers perceive the organizational support of their departments and will increase burnout. We test these hypotheses using data from patrol officers ( n = 271) and structural equation modeling. We find BWCs increase police officer burnout, and this effect is statistically different from zero. We also find that BWCs decrease officers’ perceived organizational support, which mediates the relationship between BWCs and burnout. Greater perceived organizational support can blunt the negative effects of BWCs. Our study is the first to situate effects on officers at the center of BWC literature.",

      "llm_synopsis": "A study of 271 police officers found that wearing body cameras increases officer burnout and makes them feel less supported by their departments, likely because the cameras create a sense of constant surveillance at work. However, when police departments actively work to support their officers, this can reduce the negative effects of body camera programs. This research is important because it shows that body cameras don't just affect police interactions with the public—they also impact officer well-being, which departments need to consider when implementing these technologies.",

This is a largely unexamined but salient question in the use-of-force literature and is important given the ongoing public discourse regarding police use-of-force, community standards, and perceived gaps between the two. This study focuses on two main research questions: Are substantial portions of the public predisposed to disapprove of legally reasonable police use-of-force? If so, what are the principal correlates of those disapproving attitudes? We analyze responses (n = 20,781) to General Social Survey (GSS) questions from 1990 through 2018 entailing police use-of-force scenarios that are prima facie legally reasonable. We find a substantial proportion of GSS respondents have expressed their disapproval of legally reasonable, justifiable police uses-of-force over the entire period, and such disapproval has increased over time. Causes and policy implications of this misalignment are discussed.",

While prior work emphasizes the technological features driving public opinion, we investigate how public trust and support for AI in government vary with the institutional context. We administer a pre‐registered survey experiment to 4200 respondents about AI use cases in policing to measure responsiveness to three key institutional factors: bureaucratic proximity (i.e., local sheriff versus national Federal Bureau of Investigation), algorithmic targets (i.e., public targets via predictive policing versus detecting officer misconduct through automated case review), and agency capacity (i.e., necessary resources and expertise). We find that the public clearly prefers local over national law enforcement use of AI, while reactions to different algorithmic targets are more limited and politicized. However, we find no responsiveness to agency capacity or lack thereof. The findings suggest the need for greater scholarly, practitioner, and public attention to organizational, not only technical, prerequisites for successful government implementation of AI.",

The effort manifests in interpersonal interactions, whether face to face or voice to voice, and can increase stress and burnout. Most research in emotional labor is based on North American samples. Could public servants in different cultures experience emotional labor differently? We test the provocative hypothesis that emotional labor is less stressful for people in collectivist cultures, due to the predominance of harmony and interdependence in such cultures. Our results confirm that emotional labor via surface acting leads to burnout to a lesser degree for respondents in collectivist cultures compared with individualistic cultures. Emotional labor via deep acting actually lowers burnout in collectivist cultures. We also find that emotional labor theories based on North American studies may be used in Eastern contexts, and that public servants in collectivist cultures are more responsive to display rules compared with those in individualist cultures.",

Law enforcement adoption of surveillance technology often outpaces the laws and regulations that would ensure their appropriate use, and the negative consequences are rarely anticipated, particularly as they relate to privacy concerns. To date, the BWC policy narrative in the United States frames the technology as a method to increase transparency in police–community interactions and build legitimacy. However, irrespective of how noble the original intent, technologies tend to morph from beneficence to overt control in the absence of countervailing friction. This article critiques the increased transparency brought about by BWCs to broadly explore the impact of increased exposure on victims, and concludes by proposing ethical policy principles to limit the harms the new technology could pose to vulnerable victims of domestic and sexual violence.",

Using Bayesian structural time‐series modeling with daily data to construct a synthetic counterfactual, we test whether calls to police and/or emergency hotlines varied in 2020 as people stayed home due to COVID‐19. Across this sample, we estimate there were approximately 1030 more calls to police and 1671 more calls to emergency hotlines than would have occurred absent the pandemic. Policy Implications : Interagency data sharing and analysis holds great promise for better understanding localized trends in DV in real time. Research‐practitioner partnerships can help DV coordinated community response teams (CCRTs) develop accessible and sustainable dashboards to visualize data and advance community transparency. As calls for drastic changes in policing are realized, prioritization of finite resources will become critical. Data‐driven decision‐making by CCRTs provides an opportunity to work within resource constraints without compromising the safety of DV victims.",

The study also demonstrates that tracking data from multiple sources in real-time can help police and community organizations work together more effectively to respond to domestic violence.",

      "abstract": "Purpose This study introduces emotional labor into an analysis of multiple dimensions of burnout in sworn and civilian employees across three law enforcement agencies. Design/methodology/approach Using data from a survey of law enforcement employees in a metropolitan police department, a full-service sheriff's department, and a state corrections agency located in the western United States ( n = 1,921), we test the explanatory power of an emotional labor-based model of burnout. Findings Results partially confirm the lone prior study to examine civilian and sworn personnel. Sworn and civilian employees experience variant levels of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, though the underlying emotional labor correlates are significantly related to burnout for both groups. Further, we extend prior results by capturing multiple facets of burnout as well as contributing an emotional labor explanation for burnout, while controlling for individual demographic characteristics and agency type. Research limitations/implications Law enforcement agencies rely upon non-sworn employees to support their missions. The experience of non-sworn law enforcement personnel is under-researched in both the emotional labor and law enforcement organizational literature. Burnout is a phenomenon that has high costs for both employees and organizations, particularly in the law enforcement context. Investigating the emotional labor experience of employees is critical for practitioners who are tasked with effectively managing both groups. Originality/value One previous study has investigated the emotional labor of civilians in law enforcement and used community-level predictions for burnout. This study builds on those findings by capturing two facets of burnout rather than the lone gauge of burnout used in the previous study. Furthermore, we use an emotional labor model to investigate emotional exhaustion and depersonalization reported by sworn and civilian personnel.",

These findings matter because law enforcement agencies increasingly rely on civilian employees to support their operations, yet little research has explored how the emotional stress of police work affects non-sworn personnel who interact with the public and support critical functions.",

Body‐worn cameras (BWCs) are a workplace surveillance technology intended to monitor officer behavior in the field, but officers exercise discretion over whether or not to activate their cameras. So, what drives officers to activate BWCs? Combining unique survey and administrative data, three competing explanations of BWC activation are compared in one department: Officer demographics, job function, and attitudes. Job function covariates offer robust predictive power of BWC activation frequency. Demographics do not predict BWC activations except rank, which negatively correlates with activation. Though the bulk of attitudinal measures do not predict BWC activations, negative relationships are noted with how officers perceive BWCs to impact their professional discretion, and their belief that cameras expose officers to public outrage and disapproval.",

How do officers experience heightened monitoring? This article pursues two objectives via two studies. In the first study, we establish a valid and reliable scale to measure police officer perceptions of the risks posed to them by the recording and distribution of BWC footage, conceptualized as Perceived Intensity of Monitoring (PIM). Based on a survey of 617 police officers, we evaluate an 11-item questionnaire and assess internal consistency and construct validity, perform exploratory factor analysis, and derive a PIM Scale composed of three factors measuring officer perceptions of discretion, disapproval, and distribution effects. In the second study, we evaluate the PIM Scale’s ability to predict officer emotional exhaustion, discriminating between BWC and non-BWC equipped officers. This study contributes to evolving work in BWC research by developing a useful measure for police administrators and practitioners charged with making decisions related to BWC implementation and policy. Further, the PIM Scale is applicable across professions other than policing, as surveillant workplace monitoring and technologies of accountability continue to expand to other contexts.",

With the rollout of a vaccine beginning in early 2021, there is hoped for relief on the horizon. However, to date, no study has reported the vaccine's effect on infection rates within the law enforcement workforce. We address that gap with a report on a single large agency's experience, using data on officer positivity rates gathered over 341 days. During the immunization period, employees accepted vaccination at over 70% uptake. Results show the vaccine eliminated new cases of COVID-19 among the agency's nearly 700 employees within weeks. As other agencies consider their vaccination programs, they should consider communicating early and often about the impact of the pandemic on operations and the efficacy of vaccination, including the results reported here.",

Specifically, we conducted an original survey experiment to determine whether research information treatments influence respondents’ views on the effectiveness of the police in reducing crime, defunding and refunding police budgets, and use of body‐worn cameras. Our results indicated that presenting confirmatory research information had a significant positive impact on perceptions of police effectiveness in reducing crime and use of body‐worn cameras compared to comparison groups. Conversely, presenting “negative” research information had a significant negative effect on these perceptions. Interestingly, neither positive nor negative research information treatments related to defunding versus refunding the police had a statistically significant impact on respondents compared to comparison groups, suggesting that research findings have limited effects on more ideologically complex policing topics. Policy implications Scientific research can effectively shape public perceptions of police effectiveness in reducing crime and the use of body‐worn cameras, but it has limited effects on politically charged issues, such as defunding and refunding the police. To enhance the impact of evidence‐based policing, we suggest that police administrators collaborate with researchers to evaluate new policies and disseminate these findings widely to the public. Additionally, researchers should strive to make their research more accessible to the general public, beyond academic journals, scientific conferences, and paywalls. We recommend using open‐access platforms, social media, and other media outlets to disseminate unbiased, evidence‐based research on policing that is digestible to the public.",

We estimate Bayesian Holt-Winters state-space models for each CFS priority level. Using a novel dataset that combines data from the Salt Lake City Police Department's staffing and Computer-Aided Dispatch (CAD) systems at the daily level over seven years, we estimate the effects that staffing, overtime, call volume, and the level of proactive work (e.g., traffic stops, pedestrian stops, business checks) have on police response times. Our findings indicate that the impact of staffing on response times is significantly greater than that of other independent variables in the models. Furthermore, improvements in response times for higher-priority (i.e., more serious) CFS have a lower elasticity response to increases in staffing levels. As police agencies face increasingly complex challenges, the empirical evidence presented herein serves as a cornerstone for making informed decisions in the intricate balancing act of resources, officer well-being, and public safety priorities.",

The opinions of police executives—pivotal actors for implementing oversight policies—are an understudied, critical component of successful reform efforts. We use a pre‐registered survey experiment administered to all U.S. municipal police chiefs and county sheriffs to assess whether police executives’ attitudes towards civilian oversight are responsive to 1) state‐level public opinion (drawing on an original n = 16,840 survey) and 2) prior adoption of civilian review boards in large agencies. Results from over 1,300 police executives reveal that law enforcement leaders are responsive to elite peer adoption but much less to public opinion, despite overwhelming public support. Compared to appointed municipal police chiefs, elected sheriffs are less likely to support any civilian oversight. Our findings hold implications for reformers: we find that existing civilian oversight regimes are largely popular, and that it is possible to move police executive opinion towards support for civilian oversight.",

Methods In a pre-registered randomized controlled trial, we test this claim within the patrol division of a medium-sized police department ( n = 85) at the individual report level ( n = 755). Analyses utilize mixed-effects regression accounting for the nested structure of report-writing. Results AI assistance did not significantly affect the duration of writing police reports. Alternative specifications beyond those specified in the pre-registration, including a difference-in-differences approach observing report duration over a full year ( n = 6084), confirm the null findings are robust. Conclusions Our findings contradict marketing expectations for the effect of this technology, suggesting no time savings in report-writing can be expected when using AI-assisted report-writing. Several other potential effects remain possible and untested.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Research summary This study investigates how information about public opinion and peer practices influences police executives' views on civilian review boards. We applied structural topic modeling in an experimental paradigm, a novel approach diverging from traditional experimental survey methods, to the open‐ended responses of 1331 police executives collected in an original survey experiment. This technique enables the capture of subtle shifts in belief directly from the executives' own words. The experiment systematically varied the information provided to police executives, including state‐level public opinion data from a representative sample of 16,840 U.S. residents, and peer practices in major city police agencies. Our findings reveal that police executives, although generally aligned in their views, demonstrate a readiness to update their beliefs when presented with cohesive local public opinion and information about peer practices in policing. Policy implications In a democratic society, the core policy beliefs of police executives critically shape the existence and efficacy of civilian oversight mechanisms. Our findings demonstrate the adaptability of police executives in updating their policy positions, reflecting their commitment to informed decision making in response to the dynamic nature of police governance. We find that police executives are willing to update their beliefs related to the public's ability to oversee policing in an unbiased and qualified manner when presented with information about reforms adopted by peer agencies. In contrast, information about public demand for more aggressive forms of oversight can lead to a backlash, increasing the likelihood of police executives to favor existing oversight mechanisms and to doubt the public's qualification. For executives, reformers, and scholars, these findings highlight the limitations of public opinion and benefits of peer influence as mechanisms for policy learning in policing.",

A body of 31 survey items operationalized for implementation in police settings were mapped onto the constructs of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. The resulting instrument was administered to 72 police leaders and researchers. Respondents agreed implementation bore heavily on an innovation's prospects for success independent of its effectiveness. There was agreement that innovations in policing were often more complex than the actions they replaced, not integrated into officers' performance evaluations, and were likely to be mistrusted if they originated from external sources. Officers were unlikely to understand an innovation's comparative value, and likely to seek their own preferred outcomes regardless. Responses illustrate how effective policing practices could nonetheless be deemed infeasible, providing insights into why many of the innovations that seek to improve policing are met with limited success.",

We use a Bayesian structural time-series model and monthly data on arrests for rape from 2010 through 2019. In the post-implementation period, we observed a downward trend in the arrest rate for rape. Based on the results, the most conservative interpretation of our findings is that the policy implementation did not affect rape arrest rates. While mandatory SAK testing policies are often advocated for based on the belief that they will increase arrest rates for sexual assault (among other proposed benefits), we add to growing empirical evidence that policy interventions beyond mandatory SAK testing are needed to increase arrest rates for sexual assault. Jurisdictions that currently use mandatory SAK testing policies are encouraged to assess stakeholders' experiences to proactively address resource allocation, consider other policies that may increase accountability for sexual assault offenders, and utilize victim service providers to support other measures of success with victims in instances where no arrest is made.",

However, “fuck” can also be used derogatorily, and negatively impact public assessments of police actions. Policy in this area is either absent, overly broad, or inappropriate to its intended use. Following brief, unstructured interviews with line and executive officers, I propose a novel policy theory of profanity, deriving target and intent. I test the theory with a pre-registered experiment administered to a national sample of police and human resources executives ( n = 1492), with each respondent evaluating multiple vignettes ( n = 5280 observations). Results support the proposed theory and generate useful recommendations for practitioners interested in strengthening the ability of agencies to constrain professionally inappropriate use of profanity in the police workplace.",

One particularly promising area of application for LLMs in policing is report writing. As many police executives know, not all officers possess strong writing skills, which can lead to inaccurate or incomplete reports. This can have serious consequences for criminal prosecutions, as well as expose departments to civil liability concerns. Implementing LLMs like ChatGPT for report-writing assistance may help address these issues. Even if not fully implemented at the agency level, officers across the country are already using these tools to help in their report generation. Given the stakes, it is wise for agencies to have a sophisticated view and policy on these tools. This paper introduces practitioners to LLMs for report writing, considers the implications of using such tools, and suggests a template-based approach to deploying the technology to patrol officers.",

The study shows that the speed and certainty of consequences matter more than severity for deterring crime at the community level. These findings suggest that prosecutors play a crucial role in crime prevention by ensuring swift and reliable responses to criminal behavior, which complements traditional policing efforts.",

      "abstract": "As the face of government, street-level bureaucrats interact with the citizenry and engage in emotional labor. Here we argue that public servants risk becoming alienated due to the unsupported emotional labor demands of their jobs. Alienated public servants can, in turn, alienate citizens from their government via emotional contagion, and because targets of emotional labor can detect inauthentic surface acting, they will distrust encounters with government as a result. Human resource management practices and organizational structures can mitigate or exacerbate this effect. The problem, though, is that public service is rooted in scientific management, which reifies top-down hierarchy, increasing the likelihood of alienation through its commitment to the bureaucratic form. By extending emotional labor theory to self-estrangement and fellow-beings estrangement, our argument incorporates all four of Marx’s dimensions of alienation, including commodity fetishism, where people are things and feelings qua feelings are part of an overall public service delivery package.",

When officers become alienated from their work, they may unconsciously transmit negative emotions to community members, who can sense when interactions feel fake or forced, leading to greater distrust of police. This matters for policing because it suggests that police departments need better support systems for officers' emotional wellbeing to prevent a cycle where officer burnout damages police-community relationships.",

These policies consist of varying levels of force and resistance along an ordinally ranked continuum of severity. We empirically tested the ordinal assumptions that are ubiquitous to police use-of-force continua within the United States using 1 year’s use-of-force data from a municipal police department. Applying a quantitative technique known as categorical regression with optimal scaling, we found the assumptions of ordinality within the studied department’s use-of-force continuum (which is similar to many police use-of-force continua within the United States) are not met. Specifying physical force as a “lower” force option than less-lethal tools is associated with increased officer injury and decreased subject injury. Our findings call into question use-of-force continua featuring ordinal rankings for varying categories of less-lethal force.",

When physical force was treated as a lesser option than electronic weapons, officers got injured more often while suspects got injured less, suggesting the traditional force hierarchy may be backwards.

Using Bayesian structural time-series modeling with daily data to construct a synthetic counterfactual, we test whether calls to police and/or emergency hotlines varied in 2020 as people stayed home due to COVID-19. Across this sample, we estimate there were approximately 1,030 more calls to police and 1,671 more calls to emergency hotlines than would have occurred absent the pandemic. Policy Implications: Inter-agency data sharing and analysis holds great promise for better understanding localized trends in DV in real time. Research-practitioner partnerships can help DV coordinated community response teams (CCRTs) develop accessible and sustainable dashboards to visualize data and advance community transparency. As calls for drastic changes in policing are realized, prioritization of finite resources will become critical. Data-driven decision-making by CCRTs provides an opportunity to work within resource constraints without compromising the safety of DV victims.",

This finding matters for police departments because it shows how external crises can suddenly change the types and volume of calls officers must respond to, requiring departments to adjust their resources and response strategies.

We compare attitudes among patrol officers randomly assigned to use the AI tool against those who were not. Methods Following a randomized controlled trial within a single agency, we conducted a post-intervention survey of patrol officers and supervisors. Results Patrol officers expressed generally favorable perceptions toward AI-assisted report writing, though no significant differences emerged between treatment and control groups in perceived utility, speed improvement, or quality enhancement. Despite these non-significant differences, 48% of treated officers reported time savings. Supervisors perceived noticeable improvements in report quality, completeness, and writing efficiency. Conclusion Officer perceptions of AI-assisted report writing were broadly positive but did not differ significantly by experimental exposure. Agencies adopting similar tools should anticipate mixed officer reactions and prioritize training, realistic expectations, and supervisor support.",

As a technological solution to the perception that officers use force too often, BWCs have not fared well. This dissertation sidesteps questions of effectiveness, however, and instead investigates how the cameras are perceived by officers, and how variations in BWC policies affect perceptions of monitoring fairness. To do so, I use a national probability sample of officers (n = 529) drawn from a stratified sample of agencies across the United States.Theoretically, I draw primarily from two literatures. First, from the organizational psychology literature, which is where the vast majority of research on the individual-level effects of electronic workplace surveillance has been done. Second, I draw on the organizationaljustice literature, specifically elements related to how criminal justice employees form judgements of fairness regarding their workplace treatment. The results show how policy variation in BWC activation and footage review affect officer perceptions of fairnessboth on their own and interactively.",

We employ Bayesian Structural Time Series to compare observed trends in each agency to synthetic counterfactuals using monthly staffing data from fourteen large municipal policing and sheriffs’ agencies in the US. In the two years since the Floyd protests began, large metropolitan agencies have experienced significant increases in resignations, retirements, or both. One agency was unaffected, two saw small improvements, and eleven saw between 2.2% and 16% excess loss of sworn full-time personnel when compared to the synthetic counterfactual.

The opinions of police executives---pivotal actors for implementing oversight policies---are an understudied, critical component of successful reform efforts. We use a pre-registered survey experiment administered to all U.S. municipal police chiefs and county sheriffs to assess whether police executivesâ attitudes towards civilian oversight regimes are responsive to 1) state-level public opinion (drawing on an original n=16,840 survey) and 2) prior adoption of civilian review boards in large agencies. Results from over 1,300 police executives reveal that law enforcement leaders are responsive to peer adoption but much less to public opinion, despite overwhelming public support. Elected sheriffs are less likely to support any civilian oversight. Our findings hold implications for reformers: We find that existing civilian oversight regimes are largely popular, and that it is possible to move police executive opinion towards support for civilian oversight.",

Methods: This study uses a survey experiment with a national probability sample of officers wearing BWCs (n=258) to assess the perceived fairness of BWC monitoring under varying activation and audit policies. Participants were randomly assigned one of six vignettes, each incorporating one of two BWC activation policies and one of three BWC footage review policies. The analysis involves a 2x3 experimental design to assess main and interaction effects. Results: Automatic BWC activation and artificial intelligence enabled auditing of footage cause declines in perceived fairness of monitoring. Officers perceive the most unfairness in monitoring when they lack control over the initiation of recording and when the resultant footage is outside of their supervisors' immediate control. Conclusions: The findings underscore potential adverse effects on officers' perceptions of monitoring fairness under varying BWC policy conditions. As this technology gains traction, the potential impact of officersâ concerns on program implementation and fidelity should be considered.",

It introduces a simulation framework leveraging Poisson regression models to better capture the dynamics of rare event occurrences and their impact on power calculations.Methods: Using Poisson distributions, a comprehensive simulation framework systematically assesses the interplay between sample size, effect size, and event occurrence rates. This approach is calibrated against real-world criminological constraints to ensure relevance and applicability. A key innovation is the \"power lift\" metric, devised to provide a more stable estimation of the required sample sizes by addressing the inherent instability in power simulations for rare events.Results: The simulation reveals intricate relationships between effect size, sample size, and event rates, underscoring the challenge of achieving sufficient statistical power in studies of rare events. The \"power lift\" metric emerges as a robust tool for determining sample size requirements, offering greater stability across various scenarios. Results are operationalized through user-friendly simulation code and a quick reference table, providing practical tools for researchers.Conclusions: The study advances a methodological framework for power analysis in the context of rare events in criminology. By integrating the \"power lift\" metric and a Poisson regression-based simulation framework, it offers researchers a more accurate and reliable means of estimating sample sizes for statistically robust investigations into rare but socially significant events.Keywords: power analysis, rare events, count models, simulation",

However, \"fuck\" can also be used derogatorily, and negatively impact public assessments of police actions. Policy in this area is either absent, overly broad, or inappropriate to its intended use. Following brief, unstructured interviews with line and executive officers, I propose a novel policy theory of profanity, deriving target and intent. I test the theory with a pre-registered experiment administered to a national sample of police and human resources executives (n = 1492), with each respondent evaluating multiple vignettes (n = 5280 observations). Results support the proposed theory and generate useful recommendations for practitioners interested in strengthening the ability of agencies to constrain professionally inappropriate use of profanity in the police workplace.",

Some evidence suggests officer attitudes and resistance to the technology contributes to the equivocal results in studies testing for BWCs effect on use-of-force, complaints, and other outcomes of interest. Leveraging a novel survey and administrative dataset, we investigate the predictors of BWC activation among 147 police officers in a single agency. With a test of three nested models, we find job function covariates offer robust predictive power of how often an officer activates her or his BWC. Neither demographic nor attitudinal measures significantly predict BWC activations, except for a negative relationship with how officers perceive BWC impacts on professional discretion. The study furnishes empirical support for understanding officers as Principled Agents: job function, guided by administrative policy is the most explanatory and parsimonious, while models of attitudes and demographics fail to improve upon the job function model.",

This suggests that clear departmental rules and job expectations—rather than individual officer preferences—are key to ensuring consistent body camera activation, which could help explain why some police body camera programs succeed while others fail.",

Although the robustness of the organic food market is difficult to contest, many debate the extent to which U.S. organic policy outcomes adequately serve consumers and the organic agriculture producers they rely on. This paper engages the debate from the perspective of certified organic producers. Drawing on the results of a nationwide survey of USDA‐certified producers, we first provide a snapshot of how producers assess the environmental, consumer, and market impacts of U.S. organic food policy. We then examine the extent to which organic producers’ policy impact perceptions are associated with their alignment with an “organic ethos”—understood as producers’ commitment to core organic principles and the organic movement. The paper highlights producers’ values as perceptual filters and cognitive mechanisms that help shape producers’ policy impacts perceptions, illustrating a contributing factor to the enduring nature of organic policy debates.",

We analyse interview transcripts using semiotic clustering. First-order concepts are organised into second-order themes which are summarised as aggregate dimensions to develop a proposition and expand emotional labour theory. We find evidence of emotional labour in NGOs: modelling behaviour for clients, serving as mentors to new staff members, maintaining boundaries between self and clients, suppressing panic in crisis, cognitive reframing, and compartmentalisation. We provide evidence of emotional labour in NGOs, which contributes to emotional labour theory by focusing solely on this important sector of public service. Little research has been done on emotional labour in such organisations, and consistent with prior findings, we find aspects of emotional labour in NGOs can be rewarding and fulfilling as well.",

In this policy analysis, we examine noncompliance documenta­tion and verification by accredited certifiers under the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Lev­eraging a novel and unique compilation of “Notice of Noncompliance” letters issued to organic pro­ducers and processors, we find a preponderance of administrative violations, relative to substantive ones. We discuss how the finding may help explain contemporary transformations in the organic mar­ket, as larger agri-food entities’ capacity to absorb the administrative costs that frustrate smaller oper­ations may contribute to organic market “conven­tionalization” and consolidation.",

Design/methodology/approach A factorial vignette survey with traffic stop scenarios based on US Court of Appeals decisions was administered to 396 police officers across six states. Officers were asked to indicate their assessment of the presence of reasonable suspicion and the likelihood that they would extend the stop for investigatory purposes. Findings Officers' reasonable suspicion judgments are significantly influenced by the vignette facts and align with court ruling expectations. However, even in the presence of reasonable suspicion, responses indicate a limited use of officer discretion to extend the stop. Originality/value Analyses of officer decision-making often rely on large datasets with easy indicators of location, officer demographics and citizen demographics, but rarely consider the facts of individual cases. This study suggests more experimental research is needed to consider the impact of case facts on officer judgments and discretionary activity.",

However, âfuckâ can also be used derogatorily, and negatively impact public assessments of police actions. Policy in this area is either absent, overly broad, or inappropriate to its intended use. Following brief, unstructured interviews with line and executive officers, I propose a novel policy theory of profanity, deriving target and intent. I test the theory in a pre-registered experiment administered to a sample of police and human resources executives (n=1,492), with each respondent evaluating multiple vignettes (n=5,280 observations). Results support the proposed theory and generate useful recommendations for practitioners interested in strengthening the ability of agencies to constrain professionally inappropriate use of profanity in the police workplace.",

So the citation \"(Reaves, 2011)\" has been removed from the Abstract. Please check and confirm. This chapter aims to identify and contrast characteristics of emotional labor in both sworn and civilian employees in a large US corrections department.Drawing on quantitative data (n = 934) collected from an extensive survey project conducted in August 2018, we center emotional labor at its intersection with job function. Results show that while the accepted framework of emotional labor holds across job function, the established model of emotional labor and burnout does not adequately describe the experiences of the differing subgroups. Comparing and contrasting the emotional labor experience of employees who work alongside each other, but whose work lives have different demands, outcomes, and experiences, is critical for criminal justice administrators who are tasked with effectively managing both groups. The chapter concludes with a set of learning objectives that highlight the varying paths to burnout for both sworn and civilian employees.",

      "abstract": "The initial interaction between rape victims and police can affect how these cases progress through the criminal justice system. In one US state capitol, the police agency determined its initial response to rape victims was less effective than desired. Victim retention was low, and officer written reports were found to endorse negative stereotypes about rape victims. A four-hour training highlighting trauma-informed and victim-supportive police response was developed and implemented, and all agency officers were trained (n=~600). Compared to the six months before training, victim retention improved by 32% in the post-training period. Written reports by officers also improved, showcasing victim-supportive language and improving officers' focus on victim services. The increase in victim retention is a positive outcome for a relatively short training intervention. This chapter concludes that intensive, evidence-based training programs that connect victim trauma response to police trauma response may significantly improve police response to rape victims during initial contact.",

After implementing a four-hour trauma-informed training program for all 600 officers, victim participation in investigations increased by 32% and officers began using more supportive language in their reports. This research demonstrates that relatively brief, specialized training can significantly improve how police respond to sexual assault cases, potentially leading to better outcomes for victims and more effective investigations.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to explore emotional labour in the context of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) using word data from interviews of five NGO directors on their recruitment criteria when hiring staff. We analyse interview transcripts using semiotic clustering. First-order concepts are organised into second-order themes which are summarised as aggregate dimensions to develop a proposition and expand emotional labour theory. We find evidence of emotional labour in NGOs: modelling behaviour for clients, serving as mentors to new staff members, maintaining boundaries between self and clients, suppressing panic in crisis, cognitive reframing, and compartmentalisation. We provide evidence of emotional labour in NGOs, which contributes to emotional labour theory by focusing solely on this important sector of public service. Little research has been done on emotional labour in such organisations, and consistent with prior findings, we find aspects of emotional labour in NGOs can be rewarding and fulfilling as well.",

Understanding emotional labor in NGOs provides important context for policing research, since officers often work alongside these organizations and face similar challenges of managing emotions while serving people in crisis situations.",

We exploit this change as a natural experiment to test three hypotheses related to rates of injuries (officer and suspect) and resisting arrest. We use Bayesian modeling in an interrupted time series analysis to measure the immediate and long-term effects of the K9 apprehension program's suspension on our hypotheses.Results: The sudden suspension of K9 apprehension was not associated with a statistical increase in officer or suspect injury, or suspect resistance, during felony arrests. Conclusions: As police agencies, communities, and stakeholders renegotiate the risks of policing, constraints on using police K9s are unlikely to impact aggregate officer or suspect safety negatively.",

      "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the relationship between police cadets’ facial traits and their subsequent promotional success.Methods: Using archival police academy photographs, we use a two-phase experiment to evaluate the impact of facial traits on future promotional success. First, respondents (n=507) view randomly selected photographs of cadets (observations=15,669) and evaluate them for facial traits and perceived leadership ability. Second, respondents are presented with random dyads of differentially promoted recruits, and choose one based on the highest perceived leadership ability. We compare those leadership evaluations to the subsequent promotional success of the cadets featured in the photographs (observations=5739). We employ Bayesian multilevel modeling throughout both phases.Results: Facial traits are the primary driver of subject perceptions of leadership ability, and those perceptions successfully predict promotional success later in the cadets’ careers. When selecting for leadership potential based on police cadet photographs, respondents predict correct promotional choices at levels well above chance as measured by an AUC score of .70. Further, respondents’ evaluations successfully discriminate both between no promotion and lieutenant promotion, and sergeant versus lieutenant promotions.Conclusions: Promoting the most capable police officers is a critical feature of public service. Our findings cast a degree of doubt on the purportedly meritocratic foundations of police promotion and selection. Extra-legal information, such as facial features, predicts later promotional success.",

Using BRFSS data, a national repeated cross-sectional survey, Bor, et al. found these police killings had significant negative effects on Black Americansâ mental health at the state-month level. Re-analysis found that its unadjusted results, which were not reported in the study, were null. Second, the studyâs reported significant population average exposure effect was a mechanical artifact of a weighting process that confounded exposure and outcome. Third, this significance was hypersensitive: it arose from the inclusion of 22 highly weighted respondents, comprising 0.02% of the sample (N=103,710). Fourth, the direction of this finding was also hypersensitive; removing 340 heavily-weighted observations (0.3% of the sample) reversed the outcome direction, producing an (insignificant) estimate that police killings of unarmed Black people improved Black Americansâ mental health. Fifth, correcting a week-day fixed effect that the original model specified but mistakenly calculated as a day-of-the-month fixed effect exacerbated these hypersensitivities (insignificance: n=10, 0.01%; direction: n= 315, 0.3%). Sixth, the studyâs causal model prioritized a media market mechanism that created exposure spillover (i.e., Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption) violations. The studyâs null unadjusted results, its significance arising only from the confounding effects of weighting, the hypersensitivity of significance to a small number of extreme weights, and a causal model that violates necessary assumptions cast doubt on the robustness of the original findings.",

Using a novel dataset that combines data from the Salt Lake City Police Departmentâs staffing and Computer-Aided Dispatch (CAD) systems at the daily level over seven years, we estimated the effects that staffing, overtime, call volume, and the level of proactive work (e.g., traffic stops, pedestrian stops, business checks) have on police response times.Results: Our findings indicate that the impact of staffing on response times is significantly greater than that of other independent variables in the models. Furthermore, improvements in response times for higher-priority (i.e., more serious) CFS have a lower elasticity response to increases in staffing levels.Conclusions: As police agencies face increasingly complex challenges, the empirical evidence presented herein serves as a cornerstone for making informed decisions in the intricate balancing act of resources, officer well-being, and public safety priorities.",

Building on Adams (2024), we surveyed a large public sample ( n = 2412) who evaluated profanity’s appropriateness, professionalism, impact on trust, and disciplinary deservedness across nine scenarios ( n = 9874) varying in intent (positive, neutral, derogatory) and target (self/situation, colleague, public). Results aligned with prior research: any profanity aimed at the public, especially in a derogatory way, drew the strongest condemnation. Meanwhile, positive or neutral profanity toward oneself or colleagues was generally acceptable, though derogatory profanity at colleagues elicited moderate concern. Across the two studies, it appears police executives are generally more condemnatory of police profanity compared to public expectations. These findings underscore the need for nuanced language policies, rather than blanket bans, to address truly harmful speech without penalizing harmless expressions.",

Employing bibliometric analysis and three validated measures of scientific reliability, we assess a recent volume ( Force Science ) representing FSI’s claimed knowledge for scientific reliability. Contrary to FSI’s assertions, our findings show its published materials fail to meet the scientific rigor demanded by the Daubert standard, which governs the admissibility of scientific evidence in U.S. courts.

      "abstract": "Abstract Does the implementation of external oversight in policing improve public perceptions of police legitimacy? Civilian review boards (CRBs) are frequently promoted as mechanisms to enhance the legitimacy of police agencies by providing independent oversight. Despite public support for CRBs, their adoption and effectiveness remain limited, raising concerns about their actual impact on procedural fairness and police legitimacy. This study assesses the role of CRBs in shaping public perceptions by examining various decision-making scenarios involving police chiefs and CRBs. Using a survey experiment fielded to 2,503 respondents, we investigate whether CRBs enhance legitimacy when they either coincide with or conflict with police chiefs’ determinations in cases of officer misconduct. Our findings suggest that while CRBs may enhance perceptions of procedural fairness for some, particularly those with negative views of police, their involvement does not generally increase legitimacy. In fact, when CRBs conflict with police chiefs, they may diminish public trust in both policing and civilian oversight and further entrench politically polarized attitudes towards policing. These results provide empirical evidence to support concerns that CRBs might not fulfill their intended role in enhancing police legitimacy, especially in cases of institutional disagreement.",

      "llm_synopsis": "A new study examining civilian review boards—independent panels that investigate police misconduct—found these oversight bodies don't actually improve the public's trust in police as intended. While people with already negative views of police saw some benefit from civilian oversight, the boards generally failed to boost police legitimacy, and when they disagreed with police chiefs' decisions, public trust in both police and the oversight system actually decreased. These findings suggest that civilian review boards, despite widespread public support for the concept, may not be the effective solution to police accountability problems that many communities hope they will be.",

Leveraging weekly panel data from Columbia, South Carolina, we apply two-way fixed-effects difference-in-differences models to estimate GDT’s impact on five outcomes: reported shootings, firearm seizures, shootings that result in a seizure, fatal and non-fatal shootings, and the time required to recover crime guns. After implementation, GDT zones exhibited a marked rise in detected shootings – consistent with improved surveillance rather than increased gunfire – alongside discernible gains in both total firearm seizures and seizures linked to shooting events. Non-fatal shootings declined relative to comparison areas, and crime guns tied to incidents without victims or property damage were recovered appreciably faster. No corresponding change emerged for fatal shootings or for recovery times when a person was struck. Overall, the evidence indicates that GDT broadens police awareness of gun violence, modestly enhances firearm interdiction, and accelerates gun recovery in otherwise under-reported cases, offering practical benefits at the patrol level for similarly sized jurisdictions weighing adoption.",

The technology appeared to reduce non-fatal shootings but had no effect on fatal shootings, suggesting it works best for lower-level gun violence that might otherwise go unreported to police. This matters because most previous studies focused on large cities, leaving smaller police departments uncertain whether this expensive technology would benefit their communities.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Police body‐worn cameras (BWCs) generate extensive video data on officer behavior, yet resource constraints mean that only a fraction of this footage is ever reviewed. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) present an opportunity to automate these reviews, potentially influencing police conduct. We evaluate the impact of AI‐led auditing in two pre‐registered, randomized controlled trials conducted within two large US police agencies. The findings are mixed but positive: In a department operating under a consent decree, officers exhibited significant reductions in substandard professionalism, whereas in an agency without external oversight, officers increased the frequency of highly professional interactions. These results show that AI auditing of BWC footage can influence officer behavior, with its effects shaped by organizational and institutional contexts.",

The AI monitoring led to measurable improvements in how professionally officers interacted with the public, though the specific changes varied depending on whether the department was already under court-ordered reform. This suggests that automated review of body camera footage could be a practical tool for police accountability, helping departments better supervise officers when they can't manually review the millions of hours of video recorded each year.",

      "abstract": "Police vehicle pursuits emphasize a central tension between law enforcement imperatives and public safety. While modern policies emphasize balancing apprehension needs against risks of continuation, little is known about whether public intuitions mirror this framework. We address this gap using a nationally representative conjoint experiment ( N = 3,334) that varied eleven contextual factors across randomized pursuit scenarios. Respondents rated perceived risk, indicated whether pursuits should be terminated, and made forced-choice tradeoffs. Across all outcomes, high-risk situational factors (e.g., high speeds, adverse weather, heavy traffic, urban settings, etc.) increased perceived danger and termination support, while more serious underlying offenses, particularly violent felonies, reduced it. These patterns align with the proportional balancing logic embedded in contemporary policy and training. Findings suggest restrictive, risk-sensitive pursuit policies are broadly consistent with public expectations, though tolerance for risk in violent felony cases may limit support for outright prohibitions.",

      "llm_synopsis": "Researchers surveyed over 3,000 Americans to understand when the public thinks police should call off high-speed chases, finding that people generally support ending pursuits when conditions become dangerous (high speeds, bad weather, heavy traffic) but are more willing to accept risks when violent criminals are being chased. These findings suggest that current police policies emphasizing risk-based decision-making align well with public expectations about when chases should continue versus when they should be stopped. Understanding public attitudes on police chases is important because these pursuits can result in serious injuries or deaths to officers, suspects, and innocent bystanders.",
