abstract: Purpose This study aims to demonstrate the need for further examination
  of legal judgments and the exercise of discretion in policing. Design/methodology/approach
  A factorial vignette survey with traffic stop scenarios based on US Court of Appeals
  decisions was administered to 396 police officers across six states. Officers were
  asked to indicate their assessment of the presence of reasonable suspicion and the
  likelihood that they would extend the stop for investigatory purposes. Findings
  Officers' reasonable suspicion judgments are significantly influenced by the vignette
  facts and align with court ruling expectations. However, even in the presence of
  reasonable suspicion, responses indicate a limited use of officer discretion to
  extend the stop. Originality/value Analyses of officer decision-making often rely
  on large datasets with easy indicators of location, officer demographics and citizen
  demographics, but rarely consider the facts of individual cases. This study suggests
  more experimental research is needed to consider the impact of case facts on officer
  judgments and discretionary activity.
summary: Researchers tested whether police officers can accurately identify when they
  have legal grounds to extend a traffic stop for further investigation by presenting
  396 officers with hypothetical scenarios based on real court cases. While officers
  generally made correct legal judgments about when "reasonable suspicion" existed,
  they showed restraint in actually using their authority to extend stops even when
  legally justified to do so. This suggests that understanding police behavior requires
  looking beyond demographics and locations to examine how officers interpret the
  specific facts of each situation they encounter.

## Summary

Researchers tested whether police officers can accurately identify when they have legal grounds to extend a traffic stop for further investigation by presenting 396 officers with hypothetical scenarios based on real court cases. While officers generally made correct legal judgments about when "reasonable suspicion" existed, they showed restraint in actually using their authority to extend stops even when legally justified to do so. This suggests that understanding police behavior requires looking beyond demographics and locations to examine how officers interpret the specific facts of each situation they encounter.
