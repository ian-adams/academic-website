abstract: As the face of government, street-level bureaucrats interact with the citizenry
  and engage in emotional labor. Here we argue that public servants risk becoming
  alienated due to the unsupported emotional labor demands of their jobs. Alienated
  public servants can, in turn, alienate citizens from their government via emotional
  contagion, and because targets of emotional labor can detect inauthentic surface
  acting, they will distrust encounters with government as a result. Human resource
  management practices and organizational structures can mitigate or exacerbate this
  effect. The problem, though, is that public service is rooted in scientific management,
  which reifies top-down hierarchy, increasing the likelihood of alienation through
  its commitment to the bureaucratic form. By extending emotional labor theory to
  self-estrangement and fellow-beings estrangement, our argument incorporates all
  four of Marx’s dimensions of alienation, including commodity fetishism, where people
  are things and feelings qua feelings are part of an overall public service delivery
  package.
summary: This research finds that public employees like police officers can become
  emotionally burned out when they're required to manage their feelings and interactions
  with the public without adequate organizational support. When officers become alienated
  from their work, they may unconsciously transmit negative emotions to community
  members, who can sense when interactions feel fake or forced, leading to greater
  distrust of police. This matters for policing because it suggests that police departments
  need better support systems for officers' emotional wellbeing to prevent a cycle
  where officer burnout damages police-community relationships.
