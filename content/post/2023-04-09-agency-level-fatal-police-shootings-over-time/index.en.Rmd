Dr. Justin Nix has been [hard at work locating historical data](https://github.com/jnixy/agency-level-fatal-OIS) for lethal police shootings in the United States. With his permission, the following tool allows you to see individual agencies in the dataset.

Several limitations are to be noted with this data, please see [his post explaining the project for more](https://jnix.netlify.app/post/post23-are-ois-increasing/).
