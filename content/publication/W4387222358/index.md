abstract: "The accountability of police to the public is imperative for a functioning\
  \ democracy. The opinions of police executives---pivotal actors for implementing\
  \ oversight policies---are an understudied, critical component of successful reform\
  \ efforts. We use a pre-registered survey experiment administered to all U.S. municipal\
  \ police chiefs and county sheriffs to assess whether police executivesâ\x80\x99\
  \ attitudes towards civilian oversight regimes are responsive to 1) state-level\
  \ public opinion (drawing on an original n=16,840 survey) and 2) prior adoption\
  \ of civilian review boards in large agencies. Results from over 1,300 police executives\
  \ reveal that law enforcement leaders are responsive to peer adoption but much less\
  \ to public opinion, despite overwhelming public support. Elected sheriffs are less\
  \ likely to support any civilian oversight. Our findings hold implications for reformers:\
  \ We find that existing civilian oversight regimes are largely popular, and that\
  \ it is possible to move police executive opinion towards support for civilian oversight."
summary: Researchers surveyed over 1,300 police chiefs and sheriffs to understand
  what influences their support for civilian oversight boards that monitor police
  conduct. They found that police leaders are more likely to support oversight when
  other police departments have adopted it, but they largely ignore public opinion—even
  though the public overwhelmingly supports civilian oversight. This suggests that
  police reform efforts may be more successful when they can point to other agencies
  that have already implemented oversight rather than relying solely on public pressure.

## Summary

Researchers surveyed over 1,300 police chiefs and sheriffs to understand what influences their support for civilian oversight boards that monitor police conduct. They found that police leaders are more likely to support oversight when other police departments have adopted it, but they largely ignore public opinion—even though the public overwhelmingly supports civilian oversight. This suggests that police reform efforts may be more successful when they can point to other agencies that have already implemented oversight rather than relying solely on public pressure.
