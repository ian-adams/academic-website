abstract: Abstract Research summary Several of the largest U.S. police departments
  reported a sharp increase in officer resignations following massive public protests
  directed at policing in the summer of 2020. Yet, to date, no study has rigorously
  assessed the impact of the George Floyd protests on police resignations. We fill
  this void using 60 months of employment data from a large police department in the
  western United States. Bayesian structural time‐series modeling shows that voluntary
  resignations increased by 279% relative to the synthetic control, and the model
  predicts that resignations will continue at an elevated level. However, retirements
  and involuntary separations were not significantly affected during the study period.
  Policy implications A retention crisis may diminish police departments’ operational
  capacity to carry out their expected responsibilities. Criminal justice stakeholders
  must be prepared to confront workforce decline and increased voluntary turnover.
  Proactive efforts to improve organizational justice for sworn personnel can moderate
  officer perceptions of public hostility.
summary: Police officers quit their jobs at nearly three times the normal rate following
  the widespread protests after George Floyd's death in 2020, according to a study
  that tracked employment data from a large police department over five years. While
  retirements and firings remained steady, voluntary resignations spiked by 279% and
  are predicted to stay high, creating a staffing crisis that could affect departments'
  ability to respond to crime and serve communities. This finding suggests that periods
  of intense public scrutiny and criticism can trigger significant workforce losses
  in policing, forcing police leaders to find new ways to retain officers and maintain
  public safety operations.

## Summary

Police officers quit their jobs at nearly three times the normal rate following the widespread protests after George Floyd's death in 2020, according to a study that tracked employment data from a large police department over five years. While retirements and firings remained steady, voluntary resignations spiked by 279% and are predicted to stay high, creating a staffing crisis that could affect departments' ability to respond to crime and serve communities. This finding suggests that periods of intense public scrutiny and criticism can trigger significant workforce losses in policing, forcing police leaders to find new ways to retain officers and maintain public safety operations.
