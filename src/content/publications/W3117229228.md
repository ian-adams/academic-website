abstract: 'Abstract Administrative discretion can range from benign to troubling,
  and law enforcement officers possess the power to use physical violence in the discharge
  of their duties. Body‐worn cameras (BWCs) are a workplace surveillance technology
  intended to monitor officer behavior in the field, but officers exercise discretion
  over whether or not to activate their cameras. So, what drives officers to activate
  BWCs? Combining unique survey and administrative data, three competing explanations
  of BWC activation are compared in one department: Officer demographics, job function,
  and attitudes. Job function covariates offer robust predictive power of BWC activation
  frequency. Demographics do not predict BWC activations except rank, which negatively
  correlates with activation. Though the bulk of attitudinal measures do not predict
  BWC activations, negative relationships are noted with how officers perceive BWCs
  to impact their professional discretion, and their belief that cameras expose officers
  to public outrage and disapproval.'
summary: Police officers decide when to turn on their body-worn cameras, and this
  study found that what officers do on the job (like patrol versus desk work) is the
  strongest predictor of how often they activate their cameras, while officer demographics
  and most attitudes don't matter much. However, officers who believe cameras limit
  their decision-making freedom or expose them to public criticism are less likely
  to turn them on. This matters because body cameras are meant to increase police
  accountability, but their effectiveness depends on officers actually using them
  during important encounters with the public.

## Summary

Police officers decide when to turn on their body-worn cameras, and this study found that what officers do on the job (like patrol versus desk work) is the strongest predictor of how often they activate their cameras, while officer demographics and most attitudes don't matter much. However, officers who believe cameras limit their decision-making freedom or expose them to public criticism are less likely to turn them on. This matters because body cameras are meant to increase police accountability, but their effectiveness depends on officers actually using them during important encounters with the public.
