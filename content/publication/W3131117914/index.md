abstract: COVID-19 has created tremendous operational difficulties for law enforcement
  agencies, with substantial portions of their staff quarantined for either exposure
  or infection. With the rollout of a vaccine beginning in early 2021, there is hoped
  for relief on the horizon. However, to date, no study has reported the vaccine's
  effect on infection rates within the law enforcement workforce. We address that
  gap with a report on a single large agency's experience, using data on officer positivity
  rates gathered over 341 days. During the immunization period, employees accepted
  vaccination at over 70% uptake. Results show the vaccine eliminated new cases of
  COVID-19 among the agency's nearly 700 employees within weeks. As other agencies
  consider their vaccination programs, they should consider communicating early and
  often about the impact of the pandemic on operations and the efficacy of vaccination,
  including the results reported here.
summary: Researchers studied COVID-19 infection rates among nearly 700 police officers
  over almost a year and found that vaccination essentially eliminated new infections
  within weeks of the agency's immunization program, which achieved over 70% employee
  participation. This finding is significant because COVID-19 had severely disrupted
  police operations by forcing large numbers of officers into quarantine due to infections
  and exposures. The results demonstrate that vaccination programs can effectively
  restore police departments to full operational capacity by protecting their workforce
  from the virus.

## Summary

Researchers studied COVID-19 infection rates among nearly 700 police officers over almost a year and found that vaccination essentially eliminated new infections within weeks of the agency's immunization program, which achieved over 70% employee participation. This finding is significant because COVID-19 had severely disrupted police operations by forcing large numbers of officers into quarantine due to infections and exposures. The results demonstrate that vaccination programs can effectively restore police departments to full operational capacity by protecting their workforce from the virus.
