&lt;p&gt;Synthetic control methodologies come in many flavors. Most commonly, Scott Mourtgos and I use “Bayesian Structural Time Series,” but there are others. One exciting new package brings synth models to the &lt;code&gt;tidyverse&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/edunford&#34;&gt;Eric Dunford&lt;/a&gt; just released his &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/edunford/tidysynth&#34;&gt;new package &lt;code&gt;tidysynth&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and I wanted to give it a spin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate the package, the vignette uses data from &lt;a href=&#34;https://economics.mit.edu/files/11859&#34;&gt;Abadie et al. (2010)&lt;/a&gt;, which tests the effects of an anti-smoking proposition on cigarette consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(tidyverse)

&lt;p&gt;The main computations happen within just a few pipes (ahh, the beauty of &lt;code&gt;tidy&lt;/code&gt;!).&lt;/p&gt;

  ) %&amp;gt;%
  
  # Generate the synthetic control
  generate_control()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If everything is workign like it should, the synthetic control should close match the observed trend in the pre-intervention period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;smoking_out %&amp;gt;% plot_trends()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ianadamsresearch.com/post/2021-02-07-tidysynth-demonstration/index_files/figure-html/remedy003-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can easily see that the post-propostion period is deviating downward. But to capture the actual quantitative differences between the observed and synthetic models, we can use &lt;code&gt;plot_differences()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;smoking_out %&amp;gt;% plot_differences()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ianadamsresearch.com/post/2021-02-07-tidysynth-demonstration/index_files/figure-html/remedy004-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We might also want to know which (and how) units and variables were weighted by the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;smoking_out %&amp;gt;% plot_weights()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ianadamsresearch.com/post/2021-02-07-tidysynth-demonstration/index_files/figure-html/remedy005-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smooth! The package also includes a host of &lt;code&gt;grab_&lt;/code&gt; functions to quickly retrieve parts of the tidy output. For example, a balance table can show us how comparable the synthetic control is to the observed covariates of the treated unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;smoking_out %&amp;gt;% grab_balance_table()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 7 x 4

## 2 ret_price        89.4                 89.4         87.3  
## 3 youth             0.174                0.174        0.173
## 4 beer_sales       24.3                 24.3         23.7  
## 5 cigsale_1975    127.                 127.         137.   
## 6 cigsale_1980    120.                 120.         138.   
## 7 cigsale_1988     90.1                 90.8        114.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything looks good there. One of the main uses for synthetic control models is for inference. In other words, can we infer causality for the somewhat dramatic change between the pre- and post-intervention periods? The package developer has included some very nice features to help with inference. From the package developer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For inference, the method relies on repeating the method for every donor in the donor pool exactly as was done for the treated unit — i.e. generating placebo synthetic controls. By setting &lt;code&gt;generate_placebos = TRUE&lt;/code&gt; when initializing the synth pipeline with &lt;code&gt;synthetic_control()&lt;/code&gt;, placebo cases are automatically generated when constructing the synthetic control of interest. This makes it easy to explore how unique difference between the observed and synthetic unit is when compared to the placebos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;smoking_out %&amp;gt;% plot_placebos()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ianadamsresearch.com/post/2021-02-07-tidysynth-demonstration/index_files/figure-html/remedy007-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might wonder why the plot above is only plotting a few of the donor cases. This is because the plain function of &lt;code&gt;plot_placebos()&lt;/code&gt; automatically drops those cases where the data has a poor fit to the model. This is a fairly large difference between this package, which uses a frequentist approach, and BSTS, which obviously uses a Bayesian approach. Still, the package developer has a &lt;code&gt;prune = FALSE&lt;/code&gt; argument you can use to see all the cases, regardless of data –&amp;gt; model fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the plot_placebos() function automatically prunes any placebos that poorly fit the data in the pre-intervention period. The reason for doing so is purely visual: those units tend to throw off the scale when plotting the placebos. To prune, the function looks at the pre-intervention period mean squared prediction error (MSPE) (i.e. a metric that reflects how well the synthetic control maps to the observed outcome time series in pre-intervention period). If a placebo control has a MSPE that is two times beyond the target case (e.g. “California”), then it’s dropped. To turn off this behavior, set prune = FALSE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;smoking_out %&amp;gt;% plot_placebos(prune = FALSE)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ianadamsresearch.com/post/2021-02-07-tidysynth-demonstration/index_files/figure-html/remedy008-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some researchers prefer a frequentist approach, and one of the advantages of this approach is that we can derive Fisher’s Exact P-values &lt;a href=&#34;https://economics.mit.edu/files/11859&#34;&gt;based on work from Abadie et al., (2010)&lt;/a&gt;. Interpretation is straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the intervention had no effect, then the post-period and pre-period should continue to map onto one another fairly well, yielding a ratio close to 1. If the placebo units fit the data similarly, then we can’t reject the hull hypothesis that there is no effect brought about by the intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ratio can be easily plotted using plot_mspe_ratio(), offering insight into the rarity of the case where the intervention actually occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;smoking_out %&amp;gt;% plot_mspe_ratio()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ianadamsresearch.com/post/2021-02-07-tidysynth-demonstration/index_files/figure-html/remedy009-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who want to publish their results, reviewers and readers are going to want a table of results. The &lt;code&gt;tidysynth&lt;/code&gt; package has you covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;smoking_out %&amp;gt;% grab_signficance()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really appreciate the work that’s gone into this package. It highlights the value of the &lt;code&gt;tidyverse&lt;/code&gt; with human-readable code, and straightforward piping to make for very functional analysis with limited work. Great job to the developer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest reading further, as the package is apparently under active development. I also don’t go into the many &lt;code&gt;grab_&lt;/code&gt; functions that allow for the researcher to quickly “grab” elements of the model.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Git Marker</title>
      <link>https://ianadamsresearch.com/post/2021-01-21-git-marker/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Jan 2021 20:36:17 -0700</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve struggled &lt;em&gt;mightily&lt;/em&gt; with Github over the years. I kind of got the idea, but the practice of it always left me frustrated, and the time-sink necessary to figure it all out was always just out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always manually deployed this website through Netlify. That actually works just fine, but it&amp;rsquo;s easy to lose a lot of time as you deploy &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; find a mistake &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; back to Rstudio to fix things &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; deploy, and on and on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have finally figured it out, at least enough to deploy consistently and safely. One of the big hangups I found was that Rstudio&amp;rsquo;s git commit does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; work well with bigger sized files. When dealing with &lt;code&gt;blogdown&lt;/code&gt;, the &amp;ldquo;public&amp;rdquo; folder that gets built, and that you use to manually deploy, was a problem. Upon initial commit, it was hanging Rstudio and would not proceed. That would lead to a &amp;ldquo;lock&amp;rdquo; file in the git process, leaving me unable to proceed. It took a while to figure out that using the Github Desktop app actually works a lot smoother. For small commits I still use Rstudio, but if I&amp;rsquo;m forking over a larger respository and building a local public folder, I&amp;rsquo;ll use Github Desktop to take care of the commit and push.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But really, this whole post is just a breadcrumb for myself to remember when I switched over to deploying the website from Github. It&amp;rsquo;s such a nice quality of life improvement!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Latex Equations From Model Objects the Equatiomatic Package</title>

&lt;script src=&#34;https://ianadamsresearch.com/post/2021-01-18-latex-equations-from-model-objects-the-equatiomatic-package/index_files/header-attrs/header-attrs.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As I was building a recent preprint, and trying to translate a long Bayesian formula (courtesy the big brain of &lt;a href=&#34;https://smourtgos.netlify.app/&#34;&gt;Scott Mourtgos&lt;/a&gt;) into properly specified LaTeX, I thought there has to be a better way. As usual, my decision to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/andrewheiss&#34;&gt;follow Andrew Heiss’ github&lt;/a&gt; paid off, as I saw he has been authoring the &lt;code&gt;equatiomatic&lt;/code&gt; package. The project is maintained by Daniel Anderson, and you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://datalorax.github.io/equatiomatic/&#34;&gt;check it out yourself here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty of &lt;code&gt;equatiomatic&lt;/code&gt; is clear - it takes your model object in R and translates it into beautifully rendered LaTeX equations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thought I’d quickly demo the package using some easy data I had laying around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;walking-through-equatiomatic&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Walking Through &lt;code&gt;equatiomatic&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First get the package installed and loaded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# package install
# install.packages(&amp;quot;equatiomatic&amp;quot;, repos = &amp;quot;http://cran.us.r-project.org&amp;quot;)

# load up
library(equatiomatic)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m using some data from my most recent publication in &lt;em&gt;Public Administration Review&lt;/em&gt;, which tests competing theories of body-worn camera (BWC) activation. We ask: Is variation in BWC activations more explained by officer attitudes towards the cameras, by officer demographics, or by job function. I won’t repeat the whole analysis here, but you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1111/puar.13339&#34;&gt;find out by visiting the article&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(tidyverse)

activations &amp;lt;- read_csv(&amp;quot;activations.csv&amp;quot;)

head(activations)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s build a quick (and misspecified here) version of one of the main models of interest in the paper:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;job_function &amp;lt;- lm(totalactivations ~ forcecount + totalprimarycalls + arrests + Line_Officer, activations)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we give the results of that model to &lt;code&gt;equatiomatic&lt;/code&gt; and let it extract and build:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;equatiomatic::extract_eq(job_function,
                         wrap = TRUE,        # Long equation needs to wrap 
                         terms_per_line = 2) # Max two equation terms per line&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## $$
## \begin{aligned}
## \operatorname{totalactivations} &amp;amp;= \alpha + \beta_{1}(\operatorname{forcecount})\ + \\
## &amp;amp;\quad \beta_{2}(\operatorname{totalprimarycalls}) + \beta_{3}(\operatorname{arrests})\ + \\
## &amp;amp;\quad \beta_{4}(\operatorname{Line\_Officer}) + \epsilon
## \end{aligned}
## $$&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can take the output directly to Rmarkdown using the given LaTeX!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
\begin{aligned}
\operatorname{totalactivations} &amp;amp;= \alpha + \beta_{1}(\operatorname{forcecount})\ + \\
&amp;amp;\quad \beta_{2}(\operatorname{totalprimarycalls}) + \beta_{3}(\operatorname{arrests})\ + \\
&amp;amp;\quad \beta_{4}(\operatorname{Line\_Officer}) + \epsilon
\end{aligned}
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely gorgeous! But it gets better, we can include the coefficients instead of funny Greek letters!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;equatiomatic::extract_eq(job_function,
                         use_coefs = TRUE,   # Use coefficients instead of beta
                         wrap = TRUE,        # Long equation needs to wrap 
                         terms_per_line = 2) # Max two equation terms per line&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## $$
## \begin{aligned}
## \operatorname{totalactivations} &amp;amp;= 6.19 + 10.66(\operatorname{forcecount})\ + \\
## &amp;amp;\quad 0.65(\operatorname{totalprimarycalls}) + 3.91(\operatorname{arrests})\ + \\
## &amp;amp;\quad 18.78(\operatorname{Line\_Officer}) + \epsilon
## \end{aligned}
## $$&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, copy/paste over the LaTeX given by equatiomatic, and:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;math display&#34;&gt;\[
\begin{aligned}
\operatorname{totalactivations} &amp;amp;= 6.19 + 10.66(\operatorname{forcecount})\ + \\
&amp;amp;\quad 0.65(\operatorname{totalprimarycalls}) + 3.91(\operatorname{arrests})\ + \\
&amp;amp;\quad 18.78(\operatorname{Line\_Officer}) + \epsilon
\end{aligned}
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, the package isn’t limited to linear regressions, and already has support for logistic and probit regressions with &lt;code&gt;glm()&lt;/code&gt;, and ordered logistic regressions. Hit up the package home to follow development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am completely impressed by this young package so far, and can’t wait to see what else is coming!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;General Data Sources&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The questions posed in public policy research are astoundingly varied. Crime, medicine, environmental, and political questions are all valid domains. Given that variety, it is no surprise that the data sources tapped by public policy scholars are similarly varied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, the following list should be considered only a start. All of the sources below have been used by scholars and practitioners to investigate interesting questions from across public policy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fun With the Scholar Package</title>
      <link>https://ianadamsresearch.com/post/2021-01-11-fun-with-the-scholar-package/</link>

&lt;script src=&#34;https://ianadamsresearch.com/post/2021-01-11-fun-with-the-scholar-package/index_files/header-attrs/header-attrs.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I saw the &lt;code&gt;scholar&lt;/code&gt; package &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jkeirstead/scholar&#34;&gt;has a new maintainer on Github&lt;/a&gt;, so thought I’d do a quick run through of what’s available in the vignette. I was happy to see some updates, I think this is one of those fun but useful packages for people to learn about. Plus, it lets everyone make a little study of their favorite little solipsistic research subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure you have the updated version of &lt;code&gt;scholar&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# install.package(&amp;quot;scholar&amp;quot;)

library(scholar)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setup the basic information by changing up the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; argument, just visit &lt;a href=&#34;https://scholar.google.com&#34;&gt;Google Scholar&lt;/a&gt;, click on the “My Profile” link, and copy the last character string from the url (minus everything after the &amp;amp; sign). Paste that to the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; object below!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Define the id for author
id &amp;lt;- &amp;#39;g9lY5RUAAAAJ&amp;#39;

# Get profile and print name
l &amp;lt;- get_profile(id)
l$name &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] &amp;quot;Ian T. Adams&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Get his citation history, i.e. citations to his work in a given year 
get_citation_history(id)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##   year cites
## 1 2018     5
## 2 2019    40
## 3 2020    73
## 4 2021     1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Get his publications (a large data frame)
get_publications(id)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##                                                                                                                                                                           title

&lt;p&gt;This is a post to breadcrumb the migration of the previous website. Turns out that updating the hugo package, the blogdown package, the academic theme, and installing the Rstudio preview build all in the same day was a good way to blow up the previous iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that because of a change in the file structure under the new &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt;, the image links from previous posts are going to break. When I have the time and interest, I’ll go back and fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;The ease with which I can blow up a hugo/academic/blogdown website is equalled only by the utter incompetence I am capable of when trying to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Ian T.

      <title>The Effect of Body-Worn Camera Activation and Auditing Policies on Perceptions of Monitoring Fairness</title>

&lt;p&gt;The Department of Political Science at the University of Utah periodically holds political research colloquiums (PRC) for graduate students and faculty to present early and current research findings. This is my presentation at the PRC held Oct. 30, 2020. I describe early findings from one of my dissertation chapters. This research uses a randomized vignette experiment to investigate the effects of various body-worn camera activation and review/audit policies on how officers perceive the fairness of monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;https://ianadamsresearch.com/rmarkdown-libs/header-attrs/header-attrs.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Last week I saw a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/7/7/21293259/police-racism-violence-ideology-george-floyd&#34;&gt;Vox article making the Twitter rounds&lt;/a&gt;. Written by Zach Beauchamp, the article purports to have the inside track on an “ideology of American policing,” one that “justifies racist violence” in the minds of police officers. Startling stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you hear from me, go check out the article. First though, ask yourself: How many active police officers do you think the author spoke with, based on the headline?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ianadamsresearch.com/img/vox_headline.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I initially looked forward to reading the article. I am a former officer, and now a scholar who devotes a great deal of time thinking about and researching police attitudes and beliefs. From what &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047235219302867&#34;&gt;officers’ own words can tell us about their propensity to “de-police”&lt;/a&gt; to how officers &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0734016819846219&#34;&gt;perceive the “intensity” of monitoring from body-worn cameras&lt;/a&gt;, I approach officers as human beings with something to say, and with something worth hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My initial hopes for the article were not fulfilled. The article begins with promises of a “deep dive” but ends up misjudging the depth of the pool. It soon became clear where the author went wrong: He forgot to listen to cops.
Writing an article that promises insight into a group of human beings, but then &lt;em&gt;not interviewing one person who is from that group&lt;/em&gt;, is almost guaranteed to result in a failure to communicate effectively about that group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don’t take my word for it, here’s how Beauchamp reports he conducted his research:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ianadamsresearch.com/img/vox_how.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;dinkheller-administrative-heat&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dinkheller &amp;amp; Administrative Heat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the critical linchpins of Beauchamp’s case is that this “ideology of American policing” starts in the academy with a showing of the “Dinkheller” video. Being familiar with that video, and somewhat knowledgeable about how it can be framed for police recruits, Beauchamp’s reductionist vision of it was quite startling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first encountered the Dinkheller video at the academy as a young recruit. The purpose as I remember it was in the context of how administrative “heat” can cause officers to hesitate when they absolutely should not. No one can perfectly attest to what caused Dinkheller to hesitate taking action even in the face of the most violent and predictable outcomes. Five separate law enforcement officers confirmed one version of events, centered on the idea that Dinkheller was distressed about his trouble with the Sheriff over a previous demeanor complaint on a traffic stop. Here is some support for that idea, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2017/politics/state/kyle-dinkheller-police-video/&#34;&gt;from CNN’s coverage of the incident&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the late ’90s, some rank-and-file deputies believed [Sheriff Webb] wouldn’t stand by them in a crisis. This was partly due to an incident that involved Kyle Dinkheller just a few months before he died.
Kyle was on his way to a crash scene with his lights flashing when he came upon a vehicle whose driver wouldn’t move aside. Because state law requires civilians to yield in those situations, Kyle spoke harshly to the man, who turned out to be a good friend of the sheriff. The man complained to Webb, who told Kyle to write a letter of apology. Kyle initially refused to write the letter. He told fellow deputies that the sheriff ordered him to write it or face severe consequences.
Kyle wrote the letter. His colleagues say the sheriff made him re-write it and deliver it by hand. The incident weighed on him. When he saw Deputy Skip Lowery at the gas pumps, Kyle would say things like,”Y’all write any letters of apology today?&#34; Two days before he died, in a friendly visit to the home of Special Agent Alan Watson of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, Kyle mentioned the apology. His colleagues are convinced it was somewhere in the back of his mind during his final traffic stop. He knew he was being watched, and he’d learned that being right was not always enough.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;experts-and-practitioners&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Experts and Practitioners&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why isn’t this theme reflected in the Vox article? What’s missing from Beauchamp’s reporting? Well…officers. Though the article describes “a deep dive into the motivations and beliefs of police,” a less flashy but more honest appraisal of the approach would be: a collection of academic opinions without the mess of dealing with the views of practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To his credit, Beauchamp calls on the words of highly respected academics, including Eugene Paoline, who, along with William Terrill, authored &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1080/0735648X.2011.609740&#34;&gt;“Listen to Me! Police Officers Views of Appropriate Use of Force,”&lt;/a&gt; a compelling argument for listening to the voices of actual, working law enforcement officers. The article also includes thoughts from Peter Moskos, a former officer, current professor at Jon Jay College of Criminal Justice, and author of the exceptional &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Cop-Hood-Policing-Baltimores-District/dp/0691143862/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=cop+in+the+hood+book&amp;amp;qid=1594745311&amp;amp;sr=8-1&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cop in the Hood&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (really, you should read it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s the complaint then? Didn’t Beauchamp do what he set out to do? He interviewed experts and former police. Doesn’t that get you “inside the ideology of American policing”? No, it doesn’t. Despite the excellent academic contributions, Beauchamp misses the mark fairly widely by not listening to officers who are actively serving their communities. It is clear what Beauchamp missed: the gap between expert opinion, and officers’ perceptions (if you bother to ask them directly). While I’m writing in response to a journalist, this is also a reminder to myself, and others who study policing - be wary of letting our own voices carry louder than those we report on and research. All the interesting variation is in the voices and experiences of those we study; our overlays of theory and interpretation strip out that variation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;beauchamps-claim&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beauchamp’s Claim&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beauchamp spends ample time unpacking expert and academic views on the Dinkheller video. Like Professor Moskos correctly says, this is a video that most every officer knows, but not many outside policing or the study of it do. &lt;strong&gt;Warning&lt;/strong&gt; – it’s not a pleasant video (contains disturbing audio and video of an officer being murdered): &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mssNOhv1UMc&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mssNOhv1UMc&lt;/a&gt;. If the video is too much (and it is for me), &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Kyle_Dinkheller&#34;&gt;you can read about the incident here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beauchamp makes this claim about the purpose of showing the Dinkheller video to police recruits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ianadamsresearch.com/img/dinkheller_purpose.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Beauchamp’s reporting, however, all we know is his interpretation, based on a handful of experts and former officers, but not a single, actual, bonafide officer. Is that what they think the purpose of the video is? The easiest way to find out is to ask. So I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;officers-views&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Officers’ Views&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I called six current officers whom I know personally. They range from very close friends who would raise my children if needed, to professional contacts in other parts of the country. I promised them I wouldn’t use names, but just their rank, approximate years on the job, and current assignment. Here’s what they said about the Dinkheller video. I asked them if they remembered the video, and if so, what was the purpose of the video. This is obviously not a random sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are their immediate, off-the-cuff responses that I typed directly into the document as we spoke:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officer, ~20 years, narcotics officer: That video was about doing what you have to do. It was a constable, right? He was jammed up by his chief on something else, like a use-of-force. Then when it came time, he hesitated. The purpose I guess was to teach us not to let an administrator get us killed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officer, &amp;lt; 3 years, patrol officer: I actually don’t remember that video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officer, ~15 years, traffic enforcement: That was about not letting a dude do what he did. You don’t let a guy back into the car after all that. It ain’t gonna end well, ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant, ~15 years, major crimes: Oh yeah, I remember it. It was about how you can’t let someone disobey your lawful commands over and over. If you do, there’s always going to be a bad outcome. Unfortunately for that officer, the outcome was death. Young officers need to know what to look out for, and take action when it’s necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major, ~25 years, training academy director: I don’t know if we still use that video, I’d have to check with my trainers to see. These days we introduce the recruits to those types of videos much later. That video is hard for even you and I to watch. When I did use that video in the past, it was for the flags. What flags can we point to where the officer could have made a different decision? That man struck the officer, and then he allowed him to get back into the truck and retrieve a rifle. That should not have happened. I want my recruits to have the confidence to stop him from getting back into the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officer, ~20 years, patrol and use-of-force trainer: Man, the Dinkheller video was horrific. The indicators of non-compliance are all there. You’ll see odd behaviors in the extreme. Most traffic stops are extremely predictable. When we see things outside of the norm, that’s when we need to pay attention. It would be foolish not to show officers what the out-of-the-ordinary looks like. The Dinkheller video is not an example of the normal traffic stop, it’s the video that shows what’s not normal, what an officer needs to pay attention to. When you see the indicators, the hands in the pockets, the strange behavior, the noncompliance, you need to immediately hop on that. When you disregard those, when you hesitate, when you ignore the physiological effects like the voice stress, the repetitive commands – that tells you Dinkheller has lost control. As a trainer I need to put people into stressful scenarios. For me as an officer and a trainer, I need to recognize “this is not good, this is waaaay outside the bounds of good, I need to do something.” Teaching recruits how to deal with fear is imperative. Clearly recognizing the warning signs is part of that. That only comes from training and experience. There’s no way around that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;themes-from-police&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Themes from Police&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do police actually believe about the Dinkheller video? We have four themes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not exposed to the video, or video not in use. This is a particular problem for Beauchamp’s thesis that the Dinkheller video is forming an ideology that “justifies racist violence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the video is to teach recruits the “flags” that might mean their lives are in danger. Refusing to remove his hands from his pockets [0:22], dancing around yelling “Fuck you Goddamnit, here I am, shoot my fucking ass!” [0:29], shouting “Fucking do it man!” [0:46], physically attacking the officer [1:00], getting back into the vehicle [1:10], retrieving an M1 rifle from the truck [1:20], aiming the rifle at the officer [1:20 – 1:55], and finally firing at the officer beginning at [1:56].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the video was to reinforce the danger of not enforcing an officer’s legal commands. Repeated indifference to an officer’s commands is a danger signal that officers should pay attention to. Act when your eyes are telling you there is a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the video was to instill in officers that they should not let previous administrative burdens become a death sentence. It is fascinating that multiple officers, from different parts of the country, remember this theme from their training days. The gap in trust between officers and administrators runs deep, and this is some evidence that even recruits are exposed to the distrust from a very early stage in their careers. In some ways this would support Beauchamp’s conclusions, in that there are important exposures in academy training that shape officers’ views of policing. However, amending Beauchamp’s thesis in this &lt;em&gt;post-hoc&lt;/em&gt; manner is speculative at best, because his reporting does not reflect this important bit of information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s striking about these themes taken together is the notable absence of the animating thesis for Beauchamp’s article, which is: “The purpose of the Dinkheller video…is to teach officers that any situation could escalate to violence. Cop killers lurk around every corner.” Dramatic language, but not language supported by officers’ words, either in the article (because they weren’t asked), or in my quick sample. Quite contrary to the article’s thesis that the Dinkheller video teaches officers that &lt;em&gt;unexpected danger is around every corner&lt;/em&gt;, officers see the video as teaching them &lt;em&gt;expected dangers are right in front of you&lt;/em&gt;. That is some valuable insight, and was entirely available to Beauchamp, had he bothered to ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other obvious deficiency that these six officers expose in Beauchamp’s reporting is that there is no singular ideology. This should not be surprising. With at least 800,000 officers in the US, and 18,000 law enforcement agencies, ascribing a singular ideology is tenuous at best. Doing so contributes to visions of law enforcement officers as less than fully human, as robotic and featureless cogs in a unitary system. Anyone who has researched officers knows that’s an unfair conclusion. Even worse, in the context of reporting, it is an inaccurate one. One way to avoid that kind of caricature is to spend time - a lot of time - with the people on whom you report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;doing-better&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Doing Better&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former officers and scholars, myself included, are valuable resources for insights about how officers view the world. The trap that Beauchamp fell into is assuming those insights are the same as officers’ own. This is a pernicious problem in journalism about police. Check your favorite paper and count how many times some version of “Police say…” is used. How many were followed with the views of 1) line officers, who were 2) not representing the department as a public information officer or spokesperson?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing better means listening to more people. Not experts on people, but the people themselves. Doing better allows you to avoid misjudging the depth of an issue, and revealing variation you could not otherwise have accessed. I only made a handful of calls, and Beauchamp only spoke with “more than a dozen” sources, but the variety of interesting themes is already too complicated and interesting to reduce down to an “ideology of American policing” as claimed in the Vox piece. Variation is good, rough reductionism helps no one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Journalists and journalism generally, and Vox specifically, can do better. I enjoy the policy dives that Vox provides in all kinds of areas. Like many, I rely on their reportage to get an accurate picture of worlds I don’t otherwise have access to. How accurate would an article be titled “What Teachers Really Believe,” if we found out not a single teacher was used? I suspect some teacher’s might object, especially if their actual views were not represented, and they would be right to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Randomizing Vignette Factorial Designs in Survey Research with Qualtrics</title>
      <link>https://ianadamsresearch.com/post/qualtrics/randomizing-vignettes-in-survey-research-with-qualtrics/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 23 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://ianadamsresearch.com/post/qualtrics/randomizing-vignettes-in-survey-research-with-qualtrics/</guid>
      <description>
&lt;script src=&#34;https://ianadamsresearch.com/rmarkdown-libs/header-attrs/header-attrs.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Sometimes in survey research, we want to present varying conditions in a short descriptive text, often called a vignette, and measure the effects of those conditions on an outcome of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, say we have been hired by DinoCreations Inc. to gauge the public’s willingness to spend tax dollars on our brand new Island Adventure theme park, complete with living dinosaurs created from ancient DNA held within amber! We want to know if varying the dinosaurs type and size in a vignette results in statistically significant differences in potential patrons willingness to visit. We have two types of dinosaurs, and they come in three sizes. Will our potential guests be more likely to purchase a vacation package dependent on the type and size of dinosaurs we advertise with?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ianadamsresearch.com/post/Qualtrics/2020-05-23-randomizing-vignettes-in-survey-research-with-qualtrics.en_files/mean.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are multiple ways we could do this. For example, we could just type out each of the six vignette (2x3) and have those randomly display to respondents. However, some vignette designs have a lot more conditions to evaluate. Here, I’ll demonstrate a simple 2x3 vignette factorial design, but the method can easily be modified for larger designs. The survey platform Qualtrics makes this easy, using embedded data and the randomizer in survey flows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;placeholder-descriptive-text&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Placeholder Descriptive Text&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following months of research, we have determined that there are TWO types of dinosaurs (T-rex and Stegosaurus), and each dinosaur comes in three sizes (big, humongous, and ginormous). Lucky for us, this is a perfect opportunity to put a 2x3 factorial vignette design into play!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, let’s create a place holder question in the survey. Our vignette will be about dinosaurs, and we are interested in willingness to visit our new Dinocreations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ianadamsresearch.com/post/Qualtrics/2020-05-23-randomizing-vignettes-in-survey-research-with-qualtrics.en_files/placeholder.JPG&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;building-the-randomizer&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building the Randomizer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we need to build a randomizer inside the survey flow. Once inside the survey flow, click the “add below” text inside the survey block, then click the “randomizer” tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ianadamsresearch.com/post/Qualtrics/2020-05-23-randomizing-vignettes-in-survey-research-with-qualtrics.en_files/randomizer.JPG&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we want to add the type of information this randomizer will handle, in this case, “type” of dinosaur. Click “Add a new element here,” using the “embedded data” type, and assign “type” as the element name. Then assign a type of dinosaur, I chose “terrifying Tyrannasaurus Rex.” Then repeat this step, and assign a different type of dinosaur, in this case an “adorable Stegosaurus.” Finally, &lt;strong&gt;make sure you tell the randomizer to randomly present only 1 of these options&lt;/strong&gt;. Click the “evenly present options” if you want there to be a randomized and equal chance for your survey respondents to see each choice (so here, a 1:2 chance, but for size, a 1:3 chance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ianadamsresearch.com/post/Qualtrics/2020-05-23-randomizing-vignettes-in-survey-research-with-qualtrics.en_files/type_pic.JPG&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we want to build another randomizer, this time to vary the size of the dinosaur in our vignette. Using the same steps as above, we will add a size randomizer that uses three elements of big, humongous, and ginormous, and then &lt;strong&gt;make sure only one of these options is presented&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ianadamsresearch.com/post/Qualtrics/2020-05-23-randomizing-vignettes-in-survey-research-with-qualtrics.en_files/pic_size.JPG&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the final step in the survey flow, we want to make sure both randomizers are &lt;strong&gt;ABOVE&lt;/strong&gt; the vignette question. This assures that the appropriate information is placed into our survey vignette question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ianadamsresearch.com/post/Qualtrics/2020-05-23-randomizing-vignettes-in-survey-research-with-qualtrics.en_files/survey_flow_final.JPG&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;back-to-the-vignette-and-inserting-piped-text&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Back to the vignette, and inserting piped text&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save and close the survey flow interface. Now we need to use the “piped text” interface to get our vignette put together. We have decided to concentrate on customers who will be leaving on their honeymoon soon. The plain text in this box is text that EVERY survey respondent will see, while the SIZE and TYPE placeholders will need to be modified to import the embedded data we defined in the survey flow steps above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ianadamsresearch.com/post/Qualtrics/2020-05-23-randomizing-vignettes-in-survey-research-with-qualtrics.en_files/pic_honeymoon.JPG&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use the piped text funcionality, highlight SIZE, and then click the “piped text” tab directly above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ianadamsresearch.com/post/Qualtrics/2020-05-23-randomizing-vignettes-in-survey-research-with-qualtrics.en_files/pip_piped.JPG&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, click the “embedded data” option, and type in “size” (without the quotation marks) and hit enter. Repeat this step for the TYPE placeholder, with the “type” embedded data. After you delete the placeholders, you should have something that looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ianadamsresearch.com/post/Qualtrics/2020-05-23-randomizing-vignettes-in-survey-research-with-qualtrics.en_files/final%20vignette%20setup.JPG&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s see if our survey is working. Use the “preview” button at the top of the page. Check it a few times to make sure the randomization is working. Here, in two consecutive previews, I can already see the randomization is working!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ianadamsresearch.com/post/Qualtrics/2020-05-23-randomizing-vignettes-in-survey-research-with-qualtrics.en_files/stego_gino.JPG&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ianadamsresearch.com/post/Qualtrics/2020-05-23-randomizing-vignettes-in-survey-research-with-qualtrics.en_files/trex_humon_pic.JPG&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;conclusion&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyzing the results is outside of the scope of this post, but there are plenty of guides for that. Now go forth and randomize your vignettes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Row Filtering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is useful to drop/remove empty rows or unwanted rows (for example the researcher dialogue from a transcript). The &lt;code&gt;drop_empty_row&lt;/code&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;code&gt;drop_row&lt;/code&gt; do empty row do just this. First I’ll demo the removal of empty rows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;## create a data set wit empty rows

&lt;p&gt;Next we drop out rows. The &lt;code&gt;drop_row&lt;/code&gt; function takes a data set, a column (named or numeric position) and regex terms to search for. The &lt;code&gt;terms&lt;/code&gt; argument takes regex(es) allowing for partial matching. &lt;code&gt;terms&lt;/code&gt; is case sensitive but can be changed via the &lt;code&gt;ignore.case&lt;/code&gt; argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;drop_row(dataframe = DATA, column = &amp;quot;person&amp;quot;, terms = c(&amp;quot;sam&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;greg&amp;quot;))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>The Tyranny of Feeling</title>

&lt;p&gt;“That’s the problem with police, you don’t show enough feeling,” she said. “You don’t feel enough.” She’s right, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A drowning in a desert town with no lakes. My partner jumped into the canal and pushed the huge man to the bank. I struggled and pulled, he pushed and slipped, both of us wet and covered with mud, neither of us feeling the cold water. Our new officer arrived and jumped into the scene, pushing on the man’s chest while I hovered over his face, trying to see inside his mouth. His wife, hands on my shoulders, screaming in my ear, screaming no. I couldn’t feel her breath on my neck, her tears on my head. Finally, my partner says to stop, just stop. I looked down and saw my pants were covered in the man’s blood, which had poured from the bullet hole in his temple. I couldn’t feel the wet blood soaking through my pants. She’s right, of course, I couldn’t feel enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gunshot in the basement of a home. As I made my way down the stairs, the air was filled with a haze. A man, missing his face, and a rifle sitting in a lake of blood on the bed. Three walls covered with meat. The mewling, writhing figure unable to speak, but clearly letting me know the horror, the pain he was feeling. A few inches of jaw, glued to the carpet, the stubble of beard visible from the inside. The home now filled with explosive gas, a mother unaware. A mother begging us to just let her son die. As I grabbed the woman by the arm, I couldn’t feel her brittle, old bones under my grip. I couldn’t smell the gas, couldn’t gag as I pulled the jaw from the carpet; I couldn’t find it inside me to feel the horror. She’s right, of course, I couldn’t feel enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mother, worn by the chemotherapy, held hostage. A son, a mind broken by drugs and now holding mom hostage until a girlfriend returns. I can’t feel the gun in my hands. A plan develops, a promise of a drink for a thirsty mother, worn by the long negotiation. A foot through the door, a son brings the knife towards my partner. I can’t feel my friend get cut. I can’t feel my gun, screwed into the temple of a man who’s so close to having a mind broken by a bullet. “I’ve got the knife,” the officer behind me yells. I can’t feel the relief. She’s right, of course, I couldn’t feel enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A breathing problem, a medical call, leave it for the medics. But I’m here, and this lady isn’t breathing, won’t breathe again. I can’t feel her granddaughter behind me, watching me place shock pads on grandma’s chest, watching me push helplessly on grandma as the machine tells me to push harder. Later now, the medics gone. As her husband pulls me into a hug, I can’t feel his heart breaking inside. Her husband has to say goodbye, and I go to her first. I never knew her, but she wouldn’t want to be seen like this, not for a goodbye. I pull a breathing tube from her throat, I can’t feel the bulb catch on her teeth, her stiffening jaw fighting this release. I pull on the bone needles screwed into her shins, I can’t feel how diabetes has scarred her lower legs. I wipe the blood from her nose and mouth, I can’t feel how cold the blood already is. She’s right, of course, I couldn’t feel enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A naked monster, celebrating his first day outside of prison with a cocktail of street drugs and liquor, kicking in the door. A boy, just eight, standing behind the door, holding a bat to protect his four-year-old sister from the monster outside. I can’t feel their panic, I don’t know they stand just feet from where the monster and I fight. I can’t feel his fingernails, carving deep and bloody into my arm. I can’t feel the burning as sweat, blood, and mace spray mix into the bloody cuts. He can’t feel the pain, he’s well beyond feeling. As he breaks the porch, breaks the door, breaks my skin, breaks the quiet peace of the neighborhood, I can’t feel his hair in both my hands, pulling him back from the sidewalk where he slams his head. Even today, I can’t feel those five long scars on my arm. She’s right, of course, I couldn’t feel enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stolen car, a property crime. A man, too much time inside bars, reaching for the gun wrapped in a white t-shirt, cleaner than any of his other clothing. I can’t feel his hands around my waist as we fight, as we drag him from the car. I can’t feel the cars driving by us as I punch. His girlfriend screams, but I can’t feel her fear. As I continue to punch, five, six, seven hits, why won’t he stop? My wrist breaks, but I can’t feel that right now. “I’ll give you this,” he says later as we laugh together, “you boys know how to get down. I ain’t never been punched like that.” I can’t feel this admiration, can’t feel how sometimes the only one who understands is the guy you have to fight on the other side of the game. Months later, putting together another Lego set for my son. He can’t feel the bone inside my wrist give too much, the sharp pain that makes me gasp. I can’t feel the wrist, the back, the shoulder that has given too much. She’s right, of course, I couldn’t feel enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another friend, another loss. Years ago now, he pulled that girl out of the cold creek, did he feel how her six-year-old body was too heavy, too water-soaked? She was the same age as his daughter, his daughter the same age as mine. His daughter’s hand-made cards alongside my daughter’s on the fridge. He’d felt enough; he must’ve had enough.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>It Will Have Blood</title>

&lt;script src=&#34;https://ianadamsresearch.com/rmarkdown-libs/header-attrs/header-attrs.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I was dispatched on a gunshot. The 65-year-old mother reported her son had just shot himself. She was refusing to provide CPR or go see if he was okay. I was only a couple blocks away. My best friend and I arrived simultaneously and contacted the complainant at the back door. She was in a thin nightgown and completely calm. She said, “He’s down there,” pointing downstairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we made our way down, I walked through a haze in the air, thick enough that it was forming waves in the air. I didn’t take immediate conscious notice of it, but both my partner and I commented on a strong smell in the air. Although I must have known better, I said that it must be gunpowder, making the connection with the call description of a gunshot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we got to the bottom of the stairs, I stopped at the sound of horrible moaning coming from a back bedroom. I made eye contact with Adam. “You ready?” He nodded, and we moved in slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bedroom was tucked off a small hallway that intersected with the main downstairs hallway. I saw the blood before entering. Three walls of the room were covered in goo. I couldn’t see the victim, but I could hear him. I saw a rifle laying on the bed, in a literal pool of blood. I forced myself to take a few more steps through the door. Training takes over, “Don’t stop in the fatal funnel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I came through the door, I saw him to my left. He was down on all fours, rocking back and forth. The first detail I noticed was his very red shirt. I saw the bottom hem of the shirt was white, it was just a normal white t-shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Buddy, we’ve got help coming, just stay there.” I’m not sure what you’re supposed to say. He raised his face to me. It was completely cut in half, the cheek flaps waving back and forth. He had stuck a rifle under his chin, and when he stretched to reach the trigger, his head tipped back. The bullet entered the soft jaw, crossing the hard palate, and left at the top of his nose. There was nothing left but cheeks and eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll never forget the moaning. On all fours, he rocked back and forth, shaking his head back and forth and just moaning. The sound is still with me. As he shook his head, the two flaps of cheek kept swinging back and forth, opening and closing, just like the fucking Predator. I swear, if that guy had stood up and walked towards me, I would’ve shot him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first few medics arrived. They had been told by dispatch that the subject was “echo” (obviously deceased), and hesitated until I pointed out that they needed to get on this one, and get on it now. They started to cut off his red shirt. I told dispatch to get the bird going now. She said, “You want them on standby?” She was trying to help me, as really only medics are supposed to tell the air medics to fly. “No, tell them to fly now, this one’s going.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sergeant was the third to arrive. When he got downstairs, he took a deep breath, “What’s that smell?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Gunpowder, sarge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nah, that’s not gunpowder.” He breathed a few deep nasal breaths. “That’s…like propane or something.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medics stopped and inhaled. “Fuck.” Silence took over, and we all hear at the same time what had been covered up by horrible moaning. In the wall, behind where the man shot himself, was a bullet hole. Out of the hole came a hissing sound. The bullet had cut through the natural gas main that fed the house from the outside meter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time in my career, I saw firefighters panic. “Get out get out get out” three of them yelling at the same time. I got on the radio and called “No flames” and told everyone to clear. I saw for the first time what the “waves of haze” I had noticed earlier were. It was natural gas which had filled up the bottom floor of the house, filled it up so much that the “top” of the gas lake was over my eyes, at about six feet deep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medics grabbed the guy and ran upstairs. I quickly cleared the downstairs, thinking the guy might have small kids in the rooms or something. They were clear. I came upstairs and found Adam sitting calmly in the sitting room with the victim’s mother. I stopped, unable to understand what he was doing still in the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Adam, get her out of here!” I wasn’t yelling yet, but I was angry. I had stayed behind for two minutes in a situation that was probably going to kill me, and he had stayed in the fucking house talking with mom?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He looked at me, confused. “Adam, get her the fuck out of this house,” I was yelling now. The mother stood up, saying she needed shoes. I grabbed her, probably too hard on the arm, she was old. I pushed her through the door. “Get the fuck out and do it now.” I could feel myself losing a bit of control. I’ve never, never lost control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam didn’t understand. He had turned his radio down so he could sit with the mom and not have her hear the awful details that would likely be on the radio. He didn’t hear me give out the evacuate order. He still didn’t understand, but he trusted me, or was scared by my reaction, I’m not sure. He stepped between me and the mom, who was still trying to get inside. He did what had to be done, but he did it gently, at least. I couldn’t manage that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went back in with some haz-mat guys ten minutes later. The horror of the room was more noticeable this time. I saw the little bone and teeth chips were stuck in the soles of my boot. I saw that huge glops of human goo were dripping down the walls. I got to the clean wall, the only wall without spackled meat all over it. It was the wall he had faced when he pulled the trigger. I looked down and saw his chin, laying on the carpet at my feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Dispatch, check with the hospital, see if they want this tissue.” I couldn’t believe I was even asking. The dude was going to die, I knew it, everyone knew it, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s affirm, they want it delivered.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Copy.” How…the…fuck. My sergeant, one of my best friends, offered to do it. “Nah sarge, fuck it, I’ll get it.” I knew I was already gonna feel this one, no need for anyone else to take more of a hit on this. I grabbed a bio sack from one of the firefighters and went upstairs to the freezer. I put a layer of ice inside and went back to the chin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know how sometimes it’s the false expectations that get you? I went to pick up the chin. I knew it would be hard, like chins are. When I grabbed it, though, it felt like unset jello. Of course it did, there was no bone there, it was literally just the chin. It had fallen goo side down, and stuck to the carpet fibers as it dried over the previous thirty or so minutes. I had to tug at, and when it released it landed in my palm, gooey side up. I could see where his whiskers poked out…from the inside. Whoever thought that there was another end to each of our chin whiskers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave the bad to a firefighter to run it to the hospital. It didn’t matter; I knew he was dead. Or going to be soon enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned later that he was 45 years old. At age 35, he got a degenerative brain disease, Huntington’s or something. It took him pretty quick, leaving him with the reasoning skills of an eight-year-old. His mother begged us on the front grass, after I probably bruised her arm, just to let him die. Where’s the DNR? I asked. There wasn’t one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He died two hours after shooting himself. They pumped blood bag after blood bag into him, but it all just came out his massive facial wounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ME called me that night, asked, “So, that was a weird one huh?” Fucking ME’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’ya need man?” I asked him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You notice anything strange in there?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…nope. Just another fucking suicide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, figured. Alright, see you on the next one,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yup.”&lt;/p&gt;
