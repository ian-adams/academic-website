abstract: Body-worn cameras (BWCs) are a permanent, though not well understood, feature
  of modern US policing. As a technological solution to the perception that officers
  use force too often, BWCs have not fared well. This dissertation sidesteps questions
  of effectiveness, however, and instead investigates how the cameras are perceived
  by officers, and how variations in BWC policies affect perceptions of monitoring
  fairness. To do so, I use a national probability sample of officers (n = 529) drawn
  from a stratified sample of agencies across the United States.Theoretically, I draw
  primarily from two literatures. First, from the organizational psychology literature,
  which is where the vast majority of research on the individual-level effects of
  electronic workplace surveillance has been done. Second, I draw on the organizationaljustice
  literature, specifically elements related to how criminal justice employees form
  judgements of fairness regarding their workplace treatment. The results show how
  policy variation in BWC activation and footage review affect officer perceptions
  of fairnessboth on their own and interactively.
summary: This study surveyed 529 police officers nationwide to understand how they
  feel about wearing body cameras and whether different department policies affect
  their sense of being fairly monitored. The research found that officers' perceptions
  of fairness depend on specific policy details like when cameras must be turned on
  and who can review the footage. Understanding officer attitudes toward body cameras
  matters because negative perceptions could undermine the technology's implementation
  and effectiveness in improving police accountability.

## Summary

This study surveyed 529 police officers nationwide to understand how they feel about wearing body cameras and whether different department policies affect their sense of being fairly monitored. The research found that officers' perceptions of fairness depend on specific policy details like when cameras must be turned on and who can review the footage. Understanding officer attitudes toward body cameras matters because negative perceptions could undermine the technology's implementation and effectiveness in improving police accountability.
