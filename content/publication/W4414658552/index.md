abstract: 'Abstract Existing evaluations of gunshot-detection technology (GDT) overwhelmingly

  unclear. Leveraging weekly panel data from Columbia, South Carolina, we apply two-way
  fixed-effects difference-in-differences models to estimate GDT’s impact on five
  outcomes: reported shootings, firearm seizures, shootings that result in a seizure,
  fatal and non-fatal shootings, and the time required to recover crime guns. After
  implementation, GDT zones exhibited a marked rise in detected shootings – consistent
  with improved surveillance rather than increased gunfire – alongside discernible
  gains in both total firearm seizures and seizures linked to shooting events. Non-fatal
  shootings declined relative to comparison areas, and crime guns tied to incidents
  without victims or property damage were recovered appreciably faster. No corresponding
  change emerged for fatal shootings or for recovery times when a person was struck.
  Overall, the evidence indicates that GDT broadens police awareness of gun violence,
  modestly enhances firearm interdiction, and accelerates gun recovery in otherwise
  under-reported cases, offering practical benefits at the patrol level for similarly
  sized jurisdictions weighing adoption.'
summary: Researchers studied whether gunshot detection technology - acoustic sensors
  that automatically alert police to gunfire - actually improves police effectiveness
  in a mid-sized city, finding that it helped officers discover more shootings, seize
  more guns, and respond faster to incidents without victims. The technology appeared
  to reduce non-fatal shootings but had no effect on fatal shootings, suggesting it
  works best for lower-level gun violence that might otherwise go unreported to police.
  This matters because most previous studies focused on large cities, leaving smaller
  police departments uncertain whether this expensive technology would benefit their
  communities.

## Summary

Researchers studied whether gunshot detection technology - acoustic sensors that automatically alert police to gunfire - actually improves police effectiveness in a mid-sized city, finding that it helped officers discover more shootings, seize more guns, and respond faster to incidents without victims. The technology appeared to reduce non-fatal shootings but had no effect on fatal shootings, suggesting it works best for lower-level gun violence that might otherwise go unreported to police. This matters because most previous studies focused on large cities, leaving smaller police departments uncertain whether this expensive technology would benefit their communities.

## Abstract

Abstract Existing evaluations of gunshot-detection technology (GDT) overwhelmingly study large urban departments, leaving its effectiveness for mid-sized agencies unclear. Leveraging weekly panel data from Columbia, South Carolina, we apply two-way fixed-effects difference-in-differences models to estimate GDT’s impact on five outcomes: reported shootings, firearm seizures, shootings that result in a seizure, fatal and non-fatal shootings, and the time required to recover crime guns. After implementation, GDT zones exhibited a marked rise in detected shootings – consistent with improved surveillance rather than increased gunfire – alongside discernible gains in both total firearm seizures and seizures linked to shooting events. Non-fatal shootings declined relative to comparison areas, and crime guns tied to incidents without victims or property damage were recovered appreciably faster. No corresponding change emerged for fatal shootings or for recovery times when a person was struck. Overall, the evidence indicates that GDT broadens police awareness of gun violence, modestly enhances firearm interdiction, and accelerates gun recovery in otherwise under-reported cases, offering practical benefits at the patrol level for similarly sized jurisdictions weighing adoption.
