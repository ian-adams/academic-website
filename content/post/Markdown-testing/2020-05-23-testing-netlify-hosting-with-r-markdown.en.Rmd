This report was generated on `r Sys.Date()`, as a demo of `textclean` from https://github.com/trinker/textclean#check-text

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

```{r include=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(textshape)
library(lexicon)
library(textclean)
```

## Fast example with created examples

```{r}
x <- c("i like", "<p>i want. </p>. thet them ther .", "I am ! that|", "", NA, 
    "&quot;they&quot; they,were there", ".", "   ", "?", "3;", "I like goud eggs!", 
    "bi\xdfchen Z\xfcrcher", "i 4like...", "\\tgreat",  "She said \"yes\"")
Encoding(x) <- "latin1"
x <- as.factor(x)
check_text(x)
```

### And if all is well the user should be greeted by a cow:
```{r}
y <- c("A valid sentence.", "yet another!")
check_text(y)
```

## Row Filtering

It is useful to drop/remove empty rows or unwanted rows (for example the researcher dialogue from a transcript). The `drop_empty_row` & `drop_row` do empty row do just this. First Iâ€™ll demo the removal of empty rows.

```{r}
## create a data set wit empty rows
(dat <- rbind.data.frame(DATA[, c(1, 4)], matrix(rep(" ", 4), 
    ncol =2, dimnames=list(12:13, colnames(DATA)[c(1, 4)]))))

drop_empty_row(dat)
```


Next we drop out rows. The `drop_row` function takes a data set, a column (named or numeric position) and regex terms to search for. The `terms` argument takes regex(es) allowing for partial matching. `terms` is case sensitive but can be changed via the `ignore.case` argument.

```{r}
drop_row(dataframe = DATA, column = "person", terms = c("sam", "greg"))

drop_row(DATA, 1, c("sam", "greg"))

keep_row(DATA, 1, c("sam", "greg"))

drop_row(DATA, "state", c("Comp"))

drop_row(DATA, "state", c("I "))

drop_row(DATA, "state", c("you"), ignore.case = TRUE)
```
