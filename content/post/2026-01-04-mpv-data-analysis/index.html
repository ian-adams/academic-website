<div id="important-data-limitations" class="section level2">
<h2>Important Data Limitations</h2>
<p><strong>This analysis presents data on police killings, which represents only a subset of all police uses of lethal force.</strong> The data captures fatal encounters but does not include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Non-fatal police shootings</strong> (research suggests that a slight majority of police shootings are survived)</li>
<li>Other uses of lethal force that did not result in death</li>
<li>Uses of force that did not involve lethal weapons</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, <strong>these numbers undercount the total instances of lethal force used by police.</strong> When interpreting these statistics, it's critical to remember that we are looking at deaths only, not all incidents where officers used potentially lethal force.</p>
<p>Additionally, this data represents <strong>descriptive statistics only</strong> and cannot establish causal relationships without additional controls for local crime rates, police deployment patterns, population demographics, socioeconomic factors, and jurisdictional policies.</p>
