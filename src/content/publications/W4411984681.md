abstract: 'Profanity is common in everyday life, yet law enforcement often treats
  all swear words alike. Building on Adams (2024), we surveyed a large public sample
  ( n = 2412) who evaluated profanity’s appropriateness, professionalism, impact on
  trust, and disciplinary deservedness across nine scenarios ( n = 9874) varying in
  intent (positive, neutral, derogatory) and target (self/situation, colleague, public).
  Results aligned with prior research: any profanity aimed at the public, especially
  in a derogatory way, drew the strongest condemnation. Meanwhile, positive or neutral
  profanity toward oneself or colleagues was generally acceptable, though derogatory
  profanity at colleagues elicited moderate concern. Across the two studies, it appears
  police executives are generally more condemnatory of police profanity compared to
  public expectations. These findings underscore the need for nuanced language policies,
  rather than blanket bans, to address truly harmful speech without penalizing harmless
  expressions.'
summary: Researchers surveyed over 2,400 people to understand how the public views
  police officers using profanity in different situations, finding that context matters
  significantly—while swearing at the public, especially in a mean-spirited way, was
  widely condemned, casual swearing among officers or about situations was generally
  seen as acceptable. The study revealed that police leaders tend to be much harsher
  about officer profanity than the public expects them to be. These findings suggest
  that police departments might benefit from more flexible language policies that
  focus on truly harmful speech rather than blanket rules that treat all swearing
  the same way.

## Summary

Researchers surveyed over 2,400 people to understand how the public views police officers using profanity in different situations, finding that context matters significantly—while swearing at the public, especially in a mean-spirited way, was widely condemned, casual swearing among officers or about situations was generally seen as acceptable. The study revealed that police leaders tend to be much harsher about officer profanity than the public expects them to be. These findings suggest that police departments might benefit from more flexible language policies that focus on truly harmful speech rather than blanket rules that treat all swearing the same way.
