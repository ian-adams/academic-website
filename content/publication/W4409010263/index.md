abstract: The study described in the source article represents the first experimental
  evaluation of AIassisted police report writing, even as agencies are already adopting
  these unproven tools. AI-assisted report writing did not significantly reduce police
  report writing times, contrary to marketing claims. There may be other potential
  benefits from using AI tools such as improved report quality, consistency, and supervisor
  efficiency, but those will require further exploration. Agencies considering adoption
  of AI tools in policing should exercise caution due to limited efficiency gains
  and potential unintended consequences.
summary: Researchers tested whether artificial intelligence tools actually help police
  officers write reports faster, as companies selling these technologies claim. The
  study found that AI assistance did not significantly reduce the time it takes officers
  to complete their reports. This matters because police departments are already spending
  money on unproven AI tools that may not deliver the promised efficiency benefits,
  suggesting agencies should be more cautious before adopting these technologies.

## Summary

Researchers tested whether artificial intelligence tools actually help police officers write reports faster, as companies selling these technologies claim. The study found that AI assistance did not significantly reduce the time it takes officers to complete their reports. This matters because police departments are already spending money on unproven AI tools that may not deliver the promised efficiency benefits, suggesting agencies should be more cautious before adopting these technologies.

## Abstract

The study described in the source article represents the first experimental evaluation of AIassisted police report writing, even as agencies are already adopting these unproven tools. AI-assisted report writing did not significantly reduce police report writing times, contrary to marketing claims. There may be other potential benefits from using AI tools such as improved report quality, consistency, and supervisor efficiency, but those will require further exploration. Agencies considering adoption of AI tools in policing should exercise caution due to limited efficiency gains and potential unintended consequences.
