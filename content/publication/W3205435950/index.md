abstract: 'Research Summary: We examine changes in help-seeking for domestic violence
  (DV) in seven U.S. cities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using Bayesian structural
  time-series modeling with daily data to construct a synthetic counterfactual, we
  test whether calls to police and/or emergency hotlines varied in 2020 as people
  stayed home due to COVID-19. Across this sample, we estimate there were approximately
  1,030 more calls to police and 1,671 more calls to emergency hotlines than would
  have occurred absent the pandemic. Policy Implications: Inter-agency data sharing
  and analysis holds great promise for better understanding localized trends in DV
  in real time. Research-practitioner partnerships can help DV coordinated community
  response teams (CCRTs) develop accessible and sustainable dashboards to visualize
  data and advance community transparency. As calls for drastic changes in policing
  are realized, prioritization of finite resources will become critical. Data-driven
  decision-making by CCRTs provides an opportunity to work within resource constraints
  without compromising the safety of DV victims.'
summary: Researchers analyzed emergency calls in seven U.S. cities and found that
  domestic violence calls to both police (about 1,030 more calls) and emergency hotlines
  (about 1,671 more calls) increased significantly during 2020 when COVID-19 stay-at-home
  orders kept people confined to their homes. This finding matters for police departments
  because it shows how external crises can suddenly change the types and volume of
  calls officers must respond to, requiring departments to adjust their resources
  and response strategies. The study also demonstrates how police can work more effectively
  with domestic violence organizations by sharing data to better track and respond
  to these crimes in their communities.

## Summary

Researchers analyzed emergency calls in seven U.S. cities and found that domestic violence calls to both police (about 1,030 more calls) and emergency hotlines (about 1,671 more calls) increased significantly during 2020 when COVID-19 stay-at-home orders kept people confined to their homes. This finding matters for police departments because it shows how external crises can suddenly change the types and volume of calls officers must respond to, requiring departments to adjust their resources and response strategies. The study also demonstrates how police can work more effectively with domestic violence organizations by sharing data to better track and respond to these crimes in their communities.
