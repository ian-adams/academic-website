abstract: Body-worn cameras (BWCs) are the latest and perhaps most tangible answer
  to complex social questions regarding the use of force, state legitimacy, and the
  proper role of police in a liberal democracy. How do officers experience heightened
  monitoring? This article pursues two objectives via two studies. In the first study,
  we establish a valid and reliable scale to measure police officer perceptions of
  the risks posed to them by the recording and distribution of BWC footage, conceptualized
  as Perceived Intensity of Monitoring (PIM). Based on a survey of 617 police officers,
  we evaluate an 11-item questionnaire and assess internal consistency and construct
  validity, perform exploratory factor analysis, and derive a PIM Scale composed of
  three factors measuring officer perceptions of discretion, disapproval, and distribution
  effects. In the second study, we evaluate the PIM Scale’s ability to predict officer
  emotional exhaustion, discriminating between BWC and non-BWC equipped officers.
  This study contributes to evolving work in BWC research by developing a useful measure
  for police administrators and practitioners charged with making decisions related
  to BWC implementation and policy. Further, the PIM Scale is applicable across professions
  other than policing, as surveillant workplace monitoring and technologies of accountability
  continue to expand to other contexts.
summary: 'Researchers developed a new measurement tool to understand how police officers
  feel about being monitored by body-worn cameras, finding that officers worry about
  three main things: losing their ability to make judgment calls, facing public criticism,
  and having their footage shared widely. Officers who feel more intensely monitored
  by these cameras experience higher levels of emotional exhaustion and job stress.
  This research helps police departments better understand how body cameras affect
  officer wellbeing and job performance, which is crucial for making smart decisions
  about camera policies.'

## Summary

Researchers developed a new measurement tool to understand how police officers feel about being monitored by body-worn cameras, finding that officers worry about three main things: losing their ability to make judgment calls, facing public criticism, and having their footage shared widely. Officers who feel more intensely monitored by these cameras experience higher levels of emotional exhaustion and job stress. This research helps police departments better understand how body cameras affect officer wellbeing and job performance, which is crucial for making smart decisions about camera policies.
