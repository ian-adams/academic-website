abstract: Emotional labor is the effort to express job-appropriate emotions and/or
  suppress inappropriate emotions. The effort manifests in interpersonal interactions,
  whether face to face or voice to voice, and can increase stress and burnout. Most
  research in emotional labor is based on North American samples. Could public servants
  in different cultures experience emotional labor differently? We test the provocative
  hypothesis that emotional labor is less stressful for people in collectivist cultures,
  due to the predominance of harmony and interdependence in such cultures. Our results
  confirm that emotional labor via surface acting leads to burnout to a lesser degree
  for respondents in collectivist cultures compared with individualistic cultures.
  Emotional labor via deep acting actually lowers burnout in collectivist cultures.
  We also find that emotional labor theories based on North American studies may be
  used in Eastern contexts, and that public servants in collectivist cultures are
  more responsive to display rules compared with those in individualist cultures.
summary: Police officers and other public servants must constantly manage their emotions
  on the job—staying calm with difficult people, showing empathy with victims, and
  suppressing frustration—but new research shows this emotional effort is less stressful
  for workers in cultures that emphasize group harmony over individual needs. Comparing
  public servants from Eastern and Western countries, researchers found that managing
  emotions actually reduced burnout among workers in collectivist cultures, while
  it increased stress for those in individualistic cultures like the United States.
  This finding suggests that emotional training and support programs for police officers
  may need to be tailored differently depending on cultural context, as officers from
  different backgrounds may experience the psychological demands of their job in fundamentally
  different ways.

## Summary

Police officers and other public servants must constantly manage their emotions on the job—staying calm with difficult people, showing empathy with victims, and suppressing frustration—but new research shows this emotional effort is less stressful for workers in cultures that emphasize group harmony over individual needs. Comparing public servants from Eastern and Western countries, researchers found that managing emotions actually reduced burnout among workers in collectivist cultures, while it increased stress for those in individualistic cultures like the United States. This finding suggests that emotional training and support programs for police officers may need to be tailored differently depending on cultural context, as officers from different backgrounds may experience the psychological demands of their job in fundamentally different ways.
