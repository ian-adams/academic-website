abstract: The study described in the source article represents the first experimental
  evaluation of AIassisted police report writing, even as agencies are already adopting
  these unproven tools. AI-assisted report writing did not significantly reduce police
  report writing times, contrary to marketing claims. There may be other potential
  benefits from using AI tools such as improved report quality, consistency, and supervisor
  efficiency, but those will require further exploration. Agencies considering adoption
  of AI tools in policing should exercise caution due to limited efficiency gains
  and potential unintended consequences.
summary: Researchers conducted the first experimental test of AI tools designed to
  help police officers write reports faster, but found these tools did not actually
  reduce the time it takes officers to complete their paperwork. This finding contradicts
  marketing claims made by companies selling AI writing software to police departments,
  many of which have already started using these unproven technologies. The results
  suggest police agencies should be cautious about investing in AI report-writing
  tools since they may not deliver the promised time savings that could free up officers
  for other duties.

## Summary

Researchers conducted the first experimental test of AI tools designed to help police officers write reports faster, but found these tools did not actually reduce the time it takes officers to complete their paperwork. This finding contradicts marketing claims made by companies selling AI writing software to police departments, many of which have already started using these unproven technologies. The results suggest police agencies should be cautious about investing in AI report-writing tools since they may not deliver the promised time savings that could free up officers for other duties.

## Abstract

The study described in the source article represents the first experimental evaluation of AIassisted police report writing, even as agencies are already adopting these unproven tools. AI-assisted report writing did not significantly reduce police report writing times, contrary to marketing claims. There may be other potential benefits from using AI tools such as improved report quality, consistency, and supervisor efficiency, but those will require further exploration. Agencies considering adoption of AI tools in policing should exercise caution due to limited efficiency gains and potential unintended consequences.
