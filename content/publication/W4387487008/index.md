abstract: 'Abstract Law enforcement agencies are increasingly adopting artificial
  intelligence (AI)‐powered tools. While prior work emphasizes the technological features
  driving public opinion, we investigate how public trust and support for AI in government
  vary with the institutional context. We administer a pre‐registered survey experiment
  to 4200 respondents about AI use cases in policing to measure responsiveness to
  three key institutional factors: bureaucratic proximity (i.e., local sheriff versus
  national Federal Bureau of Investigation), algorithmic targets (i.e., public targets
  via predictive policing versus detecting officer misconduct through automated case
  review), and agency capacity (i.e., necessary resources and expertise). We find
  that the public clearly prefers local over national law enforcement use of AI, while
  reactions to different algorithmic targets are more limited and politicized. However,
  we find no responsiveness to agency capacity or lack thereof. The findings suggest
  the need for greater scholarly, practitioner, and public attention to organizational,
  not only technical, prerequisites for successful government implementation of AI.'
summary: A survey of 4,200 people found that Americans are more supportive of local
  police departments using artificial intelligence tools than federal agencies like
  the FBI, but they show little concern about whether agencies have the necessary
  resources and expertise to use AI properly. The research reveals that public opinion
  about AI in policing depends heavily on which agency is using the technology rather
  than what the technology actually does or how well-prepared the agency is to implement
  it. This matters because it suggests police departments need to focus on building
  community trust and demonstrating local accountability when introducing AI tools,
  rather than just proving the technology works.

## Summary

A survey of 4,200 people found that Americans are more supportive of local police departments using artificial intelligence tools than federal agencies like the FBI, but they show little concern about whether agencies have the necessary resources and expertise to use AI properly. The research reveals that public opinion about AI in policing depends heavily on which agency is using the technology rather than what the technology actually does or how well-prepared the agency is to implement it. This matters because it suggests police departments need to focus on building community trust and demonstrating local accountability when introducing AI tools, rather than just proving the technology works.
