abstract: Abstract Research summary This study investigates the impact of scientific
  research findings on public views of policing topics. Specifically, we conducted
  an original survey experiment to determine whether research information treatments
  influence respondents’ views on the effectiveness of the police in reducing crime,
  defunding and refunding police budgets, and use of body‐worn cameras. Our results
  indicated that presenting confirmatory research information had a significant positive
  impact on perceptions of police effectiveness in reducing crime and use of body‐worn
  cameras compared to comparison groups. Conversely, presenting “negative” research
  information had a significant negative effect on these perceptions. Interestingly,
  neither positive nor negative research information treatments related to defunding
  versus refunding the police had a statistically significant impact on respondents
  compared to comparison groups, suggesting that research findings have limited effects
  on more ideologically complex policing topics. Policy implications Scientific research
  can effectively shape public perceptions of police effectiveness in reducing crime
  and the use of body‐worn cameras, but it has limited effects on politically charged
  issues, such as defunding and refunding the police. To enhance the impact of evidence‐based
  policing, we suggest that police administrators collaborate with researchers to
  evaluate new policies and disseminate these findings widely to the public. Additionally,
  researchers should strive to make their research more accessible to the general
  public, beyond academic journals, scientific conferences, and paywalls. We recommend
  using open‐access platforms, social media, and other media outlets to disseminate
  unbiased, evidence‐based research on policing that is digestible to the public.
summary: Researchers tested whether showing people scientific studies about policing
  could change their opinions on police effectiveness, body cameras, and police funding.
  They found that research evidence successfully shifted public views on police effectiveness
  and body cameras, but had no impact on the more politically charged topic of police
  funding. This suggests that while scientific research can influence public opinion
  on some policing issues, deeply political topics may be resistant to evidence-based
  persuasion.

## Summary

Researchers tested whether showing people scientific studies about policing could change their opinions on police effectiveness, body cameras, and police funding. They found that research evidence successfully shifted public views on police effectiveness and body cameras, but had no impact on the more politically charged topic of police funding. This suggests that while scientific research can influence public opinion on some policing issues, deeply political topics may be resistant to evidence-based persuasion.
