abstract: Purpose – We investigate the impact of overlapping crises of COVID-19 and
  the George Floyd protests on one major US police department, focusing on staffing
  and officer proactivity.Methodology/Approach – The study investigates the impact
  of the two crises on operational capacity. Using Bayesian interrupted time-series
  analysis, the authors investigate if officer proactivity levels were adversely impacted
  in the short and long terms.Findings – A statewide stay-at-home order (SAHO) was
  associated with a sharp decline in proactive contacts, but that effect dissipated
  quickly. However, the Floyd protests were associated with a sharp decline in proactivity,
  which persisted throughout the study period.Originality/Value – The findings of
  this study contribute to ongoing research agendas that seek to understand the impact
  of dual, overlapping crises on US police departments and the communities they serve.
  The authors demonstrate a methodological approach capable of disentangling both
  crises' effects on police activity levels.
summary: Researchers studied how COVID-19 lockdowns and the 2020 George Floyd protests
  affected police officers' proactive work—like traffic stops and community patrols—in
  a major U.S. city. While COVID stay-at-home orders caused a temporary drop in this
  police activity that quickly bounced back, the Floyd protests led to a sharp and
  lasting decline in officers initiating contacts with the public. This matters because
  it shows how social unrest can have a more enduring impact on day-to-day policing
  than health emergencies, potentially affecting public safety and police-community
  relations long-term.

## Summary

Researchers studied how COVID-19 lockdowns and the 2020 George Floyd protests affected police officers' proactive work—like traffic stops and community patrols—in a major U.S. city. While COVID stay-at-home orders caused a temporary drop in this police activity that quickly bounced back, the Floyd protests led to a sharp and lasting decline in officers initiating contacts with the public. This matters because it shows how social unrest can have a more enduring impact on day-to-day policing than health emergencies, potentially affecting public safety and police-community relations long-term.
