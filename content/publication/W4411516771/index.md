abstract: Abstract Objective This study examines patrol officer and supervisor perceptions
  of an artificial intelligence (AI) tool to assist with officer report writing. We
  compare attitudes among patrol officers randomly assigned to use the AI tool against
  those who were not. Methods Following a randomized controlled trial within a single
  agency, we conducted a post-intervention survey of patrol officers and supervisors.
  Results Patrol officers expressed generally favorable perceptions toward AI-assisted
  report writing, though no significant differences emerged between treatment and
  control groups in perceived utility, speed improvement, or quality enhancement.
  Despite these non-significant differences, 48% of treated officers reported time
  savings. Supervisors perceived noticeable improvements in report quality, completeness,
  and writing efficiency. Conclusion Officer perceptions of AI-assisted report writing
  were broadly positive but did not differ significantly by experimental exposure.
  Agencies adopting similar tools should anticipate mixed officer reactions and prioritize
  training, realistic expectations, and supervisor support.
summary: Researchers tested whether police officers who actually used an AI tool to
  help write reports had different opinions about the technology compared to officers
  who didn't use it, finding that both groups had similarly positive views regardless
  of hands-on experience. While officers who used the AI tool didn't report significantly
  better outcomes than those who didn't, supervisors noticed improvements in report
  quality and efficiency when officers used the technology. This suggests that police
  departments considering AI writing tools should focus on proper training and managing
  expectations, since officer attitudes may be shaped more by general perceptions
  of the technology than by direct experience with it.

## Summary

Researchers tested whether police officers who actually used an AI tool to help write reports had different opinions about the technology compared to officers who didn't use it, finding that both groups had similarly positive views regardless of hands-on experience. While officers who used the AI tool didn't report significantly better outcomes than those who didn't, supervisors noticed improvements in report quality and efficiency when officers used the technology. This suggests that police departments considering AI writing tools should focus on proper training and managing expectations, since officer attitudes may be shaped more by general perceptions of the technology than by direct experience with it.
