abstract: 'The purpose of this paper is to explore emotional labour in the context
  of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) using word data from interviews of five
  NGO directors on their recruitment criteria when hiring staff. We analyse interview
  transcripts using semiotic clustering. First-order concepts are organised into second-order
  themes which are summarised as aggregate dimensions to develop a proposition and
  expand emotional labour theory. We find evidence of emotional labour in NGOs: modelling
  behaviour for clients, serving as mentors to new staff members, maintaining boundaries
  between self and clients, suppressing panic in crisis, cognitive reframing, and
  compartmentalisation. We provide evidence of emotional labour in NGOs, which contributes
  to emotional labour theory by focusing solely on this important sector of public
  service. Little research has been done on emotional labour in such organisations,
  and consistent with prior findings, we find aspects of emotional labour in NGOs
  can be rewarding and fulfilling as well.'
summary: This study examined how workers at non-governmental organizations manage
  their emotions as part of their job duties, finding that staff must carefully control
  their feelings when mentoring colleagues, setting boundaries with clients, and staying
  calm during crises. While this research focuses on NGOs rather than police, it reveals
  important insights about emotional demands in public service work that likely apply
  to law enforcement officers who face similar challenges in managing their emotions
  while helping people and responding to emergencies. Understanding how emotional
  labor affects workers in helping professions could inform better training and support
  systems for police officers dealing with traumatic or stressful situations.
