I really appreciate [Dan Quintana for his walkthrough](https://www.dsquintana.blog/free-website-in-r-easy/) on getting an Academic themed website up and running. 

Thank you to [Peter Paul Pichler for his script](http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~pichler/blog/) adapated from [Lorenzo Busetto's original script](https://lbusett.netlify.app/post/automatically-importing-publications-from-bibtex-to-a-hugo-academic-blog/) to import publication data from bibtex files (I use Zotero, but other citation software should work fine).
