abstract: 'Abstract Police body‐worn cameras (BWCs) generate extensive video data
  on officer behavior, yet resource constraints mean that only a fraction of this
  footage is ever reviewed. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) present
  an opportunity to automate these reviews, potentially influencing police conduct.
  We evaluate the impact of AI‐led auditing in two pre‐registered, randomized controlled
  trials conducted within two large US police agencies. The findings are mixed but
  positive: In a department operating under a consent decree, officers exhibited significant
  reductions in substandard professionalism, whereas in an agency without external
  oversight, officers increased the frequency of highly professional interactions.
  These results show that AI auditing of BWC footage can influence officer behavior,
  with its effects shaped by organizational and institutional contexts.'
summary: Researchers tested whether using artificial intelligence to automatically
  review police body camera footage could improve officer behavior in two large US
  police departments. The AI monitoring led to measurable improvements in how professionally
  officers interacted with the public, though the specific changes varied depending
  on whether the department was already under court-ordered reform. This suggests
  that automated review of body camera footage could be a practical tool for police
  accountability, helping departments better supervise officers when they can't manually
  review the millions of hours of video recorded each year.

## Summary

Researchers tested whether using artificial intelligence to automatically review police body camera footage could improve officer behavior in two large US police departments. The AI monitoring led to measurable improvements in how professionally officers interacted with the public, though the specific changes varied depending on whether the department was already under court-ordered reform. This suggests that automated review of body camera footage could be a practical tool for police accountability, helping departments better supervise officers when they can't manually review the millions of hours of video recorded each year.
