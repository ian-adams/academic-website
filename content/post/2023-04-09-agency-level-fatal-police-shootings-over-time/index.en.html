<p>Dr.Â Justin Nix has been <a href="https://github.com/jnixy/agency-level-fatal-OIS">hard at work locating historical data</a> for lethal police shootings in the United States. With his permission, the following tool allows you to see individual agencies in the dataset.</p>
<p>Several limitations are to be noted with this data, please see <a href="https://jnix.netlify.app/post/post23-are-ois-increasing/">his post explaining the project for more</a>.</p>
