DATA SOURCES:
"Black/White Fatally Shot","Washington Post Fatal Force Database: https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings"
"Population","US Census ACS 5-year estimates (or 1-year for most recent). Look for 'one race white' and 'one race black or African American'"
"Police Contacts / Traffic Stops / Street Stops","Bureau of Justice Statistics Police-Public Contact Survey (PPCS). Note: Survey conducted every 3 years. Use most recent available or average across waves."
"Total Arrests","FBI UCR Table 43A (Arrests by Race): https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/"
"Violent Crime Arrests","FBI UCR Table 43A - sum of murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault arrests by race"
"Weapons Arrests","FBI UCR Table 43A - 'Weapons; carrying, possessing, etc.' by race"

NOTES:
"PPCS data is survey-based and only updated every 3 years (2011, 2015, 2018, etc). The 2015-2017 values above use averages from 2002-2011 waves per the original paper."
"UCR data may have gaps due to agency non-participation. Check coverage notes in FBI reports."
"For UCR, look for tables disaggregated by race - typically Table 43A or Table 21A depending on year."
