abstract: 'The purpose of this paper is to explore emotional labour in the context
  of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) using word data from interviews of five
  NGO directors on their recruitment criteria when hiring staff. We analyse interview
  transcripts using semiotic clustering. First-order concepts are organised into second-order
  themes which are summarised as aggregate dimensions to develop a proposition and
  expand emotional labour theory. We find evidence of emotional labour in NGOs: modelling
  behaviour for clients, serving as mentors to new staff members, maintaining boundaries
  between self and clients, suppressing panic in crisis, cognitive reframing, and
  compartmentalisation. We provide evidence of emotional labour in NGOs, which contributes
  to emotional labour theory by focusing solely on this important sector of public
  service. Little research has been done on emotional labour in such organisations,
  and consistent with prior findings, we find aspects of emotional labour in NGOs
  can be rewarding and fulfilling as well.'
summary: This study examined how workers at non-governmental organizations must manage
  their emotions as part of their job - such as staying calm during crises, maintaining
  professional boundaries with clients, and mentoring new staff while suppressing
  their own stress. The research found that this "emotional labor" can be both demanding
  and rewarding for NGO employees who serve vulnerable populations. Understanding
  emotional labor in NGOs provides important context for policing research, since
  officers often work alongside these organizations and face similar challenges of
  managing emotions while serving people in crisis situations.
