abstract: In the current study, we examine prosecutorial decisions that affect the
  certainty, celerity, and severity of punishment at the county level in the state
  of Florida. Leveraging a unique data set, we investigate the effect of the rate
  at which prosecuting agencies within each county filed formal charges against offenders
  (certainty), the swiftness of criminal case resolution (celerity), and the rate
  at which cases were pled to less severe punishments (severity). We test for the
  effect of those covariates on aggregate county-level crime rates over a 5-year period.
  We find that prosecutors’ effect on the certainty and celerity of punishment was
  associated with lower levels of crime, whereas their effect on the severity of punishment
  was not. Together, these findings highlight the role of the prosecutor in shaping
  the general deterrent environment within a county.
summary: Researchers analyzed prosecution decisions across Florida counties and found
  that filing charges quickly and resolving cases swiftly reduced crime rates more
  effectively than pursuing harsher punishments. The study shows that the speed and
  certainty of consequences matter more than severity for deterring crime at the community
  level. These findings suggest that prosecutors play a crucial role in crime prevention
  by ensuring swift and reliable responses to criminal behavior, which complements
  traditional policing efforts.

## Summary

Researchers analyzed prosecution decisions across Florida counties and found that filing charges quickly and resolving cases swiftly reduced crime rates more effectively than pursuing harsher punishments. The study shows that the speed and certainty of consequences matter more than severity for deterring crime at the community level. These findings suggest that prosecutors play a crucial role in crime prevention by ensuring swift and reliable responses to criminal behavior, which complements traditional policing efforts.
