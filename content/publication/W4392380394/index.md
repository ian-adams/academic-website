  events using more appropriate statistical models. This advancement gives policing
  researchers better tools to design studies that can reliably detect important trends
  and effects in critical but uncommon incidents, leading to more robust evidence
  for policy decisions.

## Summary

Researchers studying rare but serious events like police shootings or misconduct cases often struggle to determine how large their studies need to be to detect meaningful patterns, because traditional statistical methods don't work well for infrequent occurrences. This study developed a new simulation approach and a "power lift" metric that helps researchers calculate the right sample sizes when studying these rare events using more appropriate statistical models. This advancement gives policing researchers better tools to design studies that can reliably detect important trends and effects in critical but uncommon incidents, leading to more robust evidence for policy decisions.

Objectives: This study addresses the significant challenge of estimating statistical power for experiments involving rare but impactful events, where traditional power analysis models, assuming normal distribution, inadequately estimate required sample sizes. It introduces a simulation framework leveraging Poisson regression models to better capture the dynamics of rare event occurrences and their impact on power calculations.Methods: Using Poisson distributions, a comprehensive simulation framework systematically assesses the interplay between sample size, effect size, and event occurrence rates. This approach is calibrated against real-world criminological constraints to ensure relevance and applicability. A key innovation is the "power lift" metric, devised to provide a more stable estimation of the required sample sizes by addressing the inherent instability in power simulations for rare events.Results: The simulation reveals intricate relationships between effect size, sample size, and event rates, underscoring the challenge of achieving sufficient statistical power in studies of rare events. The "power lift" metric emerges as a robust tool for determining sample size requirements, offering greater stability across various scenarios.
