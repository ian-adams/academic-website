      <div class="article-style">
        
          Police resignations surged by 279% after the George Floyd protests in 2020, while retirements and firings remained steady, creating a staffing crisis that continues today. This massive wave of voluntary departures is undermining police departments' ability to serve their communities effectively. The findings suggest that improving how officers are treated within their organizations and providing better support could help address this ongoing retention problem.

      <div class="article-style">
        
          Police officers use profanity like "fuck" for various professional purposes—to establish authority, build camaraderie, or reduce tension—but current department policies either don't exist or are too vague to effectively regulate inappropriate use. A survey of nearly 1,500 police and human resources executives found that context matters significantly: who the profanity is directed at and why it's being used should determine whether it violates professional standards. This research provides a framework for police departments to create more precise policies that distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable use of strong language on the job.

      <div class="article-style">
        
          A rigorous experiment with 85 police officers found that artificial intelligence tools did not reduce the time officers spent writing reports, despite industry claims that AI would speed up this time-consuming task. This matters because police departments are increasingly investing in AI technologies with the expectation they will free up officers for patrol duties, but this study suggests those promised efficiency gains may not materialize. The findings challenge assumptions about AI's immediate practical benefits in policing and suggest departments should be cautious about expecting quick returns on AI investments.

      <h2><a href="/publication/w4400252745/" >Police reform from the top down: Experimental evidence on police executive support for civilian oversight</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          Researchers surveyed over 1,300 police chiefs and sheriffs across the U.S. to understand when law enforcement leaders support civilian oversight of their departments. They found that police executives are much more likely to support oversight when other major police departments have already adopted it, but they largely ignore public opinion—even though the vast majority of Americans favor civilian review of police. This suggests that police reform may spread more effectively through professional networks among law enforcement leaders rather than through public pressure alone.

      <h2><a href="/publication/w4399367555/" >Speaking of reform: Experimental insights into influencing police executives&#39; perspectives on civilian oversight</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          Researchers conducted an experiment with over 1,300 police chiefs and executives to see how they respond to different types of information about civilian oversight boards that monitor police departments. They found that police leaders are willing to change their views when they learn about what other police departments are doing, but they become more resistant to oversight when they hear about strong public demands for more aggressive monitoring. This matters because it shows that police reform efforts may be more successful when they emphasize peer influence rather than public pressure, suggesting a strategic approach for implementing civilian oversight.

      <h2><a href="/publication/w4391919703/" >Staffing levels are the most important factor influencing police response times</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          Researchers analyzed seven years of police data from Salt Lake City to determine what factors most affect how quickly officers respond to emergency calls, finding that having enough officers on duty matters far more than other factors like call volume or proactive policing activities. The study reveals that while adding more officers improves response times across all types of calls, the biggest improvements occur for lower-priority incidents rather than the most serious emergencies. This evidence provides police departments with concrete data to support staffing decisions and helps explain why understaffed departments struggle to maintain quick response times even when they reduce other activities.

      <h2><a href="/publication/w4402494368/" >Then a miracle occurs: cause, effect, and the heterogeneity of criminal justice research</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          This study critiques a prominent scholar's claim that randomized controlled trials (RCTs) - the gold standard research method - don't work in criminal justice and should be abandoned in favor of less rigorous approaches. The authors argue this conclusion is flawed because it inappropriately combines results from vastly different studies with different designs, populations, and outcomes - like mixing apples and oranges to draw broad conclusions. Instead of abandoning rigorous research methods, police departments and criminal justice agencies should use more comprehensive study designs borrowed from medicine that can better account for the complex, real-world factors that affect whether reforms actually work and last over time.

      <h2><a href="/publication/w4365520122/" >An experimental look at reasonable suspicion and police discretion</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          Researchers tested whether police officers can accurately identify when they have legal grounds to extend a traffic stop for further investigation by presenting 396 officers with hypothetical scenarios based on real court cases. While officers generally made correct legal judgments about when "reasonable suspicion" existed, they showed restraint in actually using their authority to extend stops even when legally justified to do so. This suggests that understanding police behavior requires looking beyond demographics and locations to examine how officers interpret the specific facts of each situation they encounter.

      <h2><a href="/publication/w4387023588/" >Does scientific research change minds? Linking criminology and public perceptions of policing</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          Researchers tested whether showing people scientific studies about policing could change their opinions on police effectiveness, body cameras, and police funding. They found that research evidence successfully shifted public views on police effectiveness and body cameras, but had no impact on the more politically charged topic of police funding. This suggests that while scientific research can influence public opinion on some policing issues, deeply political topics may be resistant to evidence-based persuasion.

      <h2><a href="/publication/w4389258124/" >Fuck: The Police</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          This study examines how police officers use profanity, particularly the word "fuck," finding that officers use it for various purposes including asserting authority and building camaraderie with colleagues, but also sometimes in ways that harm public perception of police. Through interviews and experiments with nearly 1,500 police and HR executives, the research develops a framework for creating better policies that distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate uses of profanity based on who it's directed at and why it's being used. This matters because most police departments currently lack clear, practical guidelines for officer language, leaving agencies unable to effectively address unprofessional conduct while still allowing officers to communicate effectively in high-stress situations.

      <h2><a href="/publication/w4387487008/" >Institutional factors driving citizen perceptions of &lt;scp&gt;AI&lt;/scp&gt; in government: Evidence from a survey experiment on policing</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          A survey of 4,200 people found that Americans are more supportive of local police departments using artificial intelligence tools than federal agencies like the FBI, but they show little concern about whether agencies have the necessary resources and expertise to use AI properly. The research reveals that public opinion about AI in policing depends heavily on which agency is using the technology rather than what the technology actually does or how well-prepared the agency is to implement it. This matters because it suggests police departments need to focus on building community trust and demonstrating local accountability when introducing AI tools, rather than just proving the technology works.
