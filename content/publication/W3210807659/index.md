summary: Researchers analyzed emergency calls in seven U.S. cities during COVID-19
  and found that domestic violence calls to both police (about 1,030 more calls) and
  emergency hotlines (about 1,671 more calls) increased significantly as people stayed
  home during the pandemic. This finding matters for police departments because it
  shows how external crises can create predictable spikes in certain types of emergency
  calls, helping them better prepare and allocate resources during future emergencies.
  The study also demonstrates that tracking data from multiple sources in real-time
  can help police and community organizations work together more effectively to respond
  to domestic violence.

## Summary

Researchers analyzed emergency calls in seven U.S. cities during COVID-19 and found that domestic violence calls to both police (about 1,030 more calls) and emergency hotlines (about 1,671 more calls) increased significantly as people stayed home during the pandemic. This finding matters for police departments because it shows how external crises can create predictable spikes in certain types of emergency calls, helping them better prepare and allocate resources during future emergencies. The study also demonstrates that tracking data from multiple sources in real-time can help police and community organizations work together more effectively to respond to domestic violence.

## Abstract

Abstract Research Summary : We examine changes in help‐seeking for domestic violence (DV) in seven U.S. cities during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Using Bayesian structural time‐series modeling with daily data to construct a synthetic counterfactual, we test whether calls to police and/or emergency hotlines varied in 2020 as people stayed home due to COVID‐19. Across this sample, we estimate there were approximately 1030 more calls to police and 1671 more calls to emergency hotlines than would have occurred absent the pandemic. Policy Implications : Interagency data sharing and analysis holds great promise for better understanding localized trends in DV in real time. Research‐practitioner partnerships can help DV coordinated community response teams (CCRTs) develop accessible and sustainable dashboards to visualize data and advance community transparency. As calls for drastic changes in policing are realized, prioritization of finite resources will become critical. Data‐driven decision‐making by CCRTs provides an opportunity to work within resource constraints without compromising the safety of DV victims.
