abstract: Abstract Research summary This study investigates how information about
  public opinion and peer practices influences police executives' views on civilian
  review boards. We applied structural topic modeling in an experimental paradigm,
  a novel approach diverging from traditional experimental survey methods, to the
  open‐ended responses of 1331 police executives collected in an original survey experiment.
  This technique enables the capture of subtle shifts in belief directly from the
  executives' own words. The experiment systematically varied the information provided
  to police executives, including state‐level public opinion data from a representative
  sample of 16,840 U.S. residents, and peer practices in major city police agencies.
  Our findings reveal that police executives, although generally aligned in their
  views, demonstrate a readiness to update their beliefs when presented with cohesive
  local public opinion and information about peer practices in policing. Policy implications
  In a democratic society, the core policy beliefs of police executives critically
  shape the existence and efficacy of civilian oversight mechanisms. Our findings
  demonstrate the adaptability of police executives in updating their policy positions,
  reflecting their commitment to informed decision making in response to the dynamic
  nature of police governance. We find that police executives are willing to update
  their beliefs related to the public's ability to oversee policing in an unbiased
  and qualified manner when presented with information about reforms adopted by peer
  agencies. In contrast, information about public demand for more aggressive forms
  of oversight can lead to a backlash, increasing the likelihood of police executives
  to favor existing oversight mechanisms and to doubt the public's qualification.
  For executives, reformers, and scholars, these findings highlight the limitations
  of public opinion and benefits of peer influence as mechanisms for policy learning
  in policing.
summary: Researchers conducted an experiment with over 1,300 police chiefs and executives
  to see how they respond to different types of information about civilian oversight
  boards that monitor police departments. They found that police leaders are willing
  to change their views when they learn about what other police departments are doing,
  but they become more resistant to oversight when they hear about strong public demands
  for more aggressive monitoring. This matters because it shows that police reform
  efforts may be more successful when they emphasize peer influence rather than public
  pressure, suggesting a strategic approach for implementing civilian oversight.

## Summary

Researchers conducted an experiment with over 1,300 police chiefs and executives to see how they respond to different types of information about civilian oversight boards that monitor police departments. They found that police leaders are willing to change their views when they learn about what other police departments are doing, but they become more resistant to oversight when they hear about strong public demands for more aggressive monitoring. This matters because it shows that police reform efforts may be more successful when they emphasize peer influence rather than public pressure, suggesting a strategic approach for implementing civilian oversight.
