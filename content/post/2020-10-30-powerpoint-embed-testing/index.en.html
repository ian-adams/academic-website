<p>The Department of Political Science at the University of Utah periodically holds political research colloquiums (PRC) for graduate students and faculty to present early and current research findings. This is my presentation at the PRC held Oct.Â 30, 2020. I describe early findings from one of my dissertation chapters. This research uses a randomized vignette experiment to investigate the effects of various body-worn camera activation and review/audit policies on how officers perceive the fairness of monitoring.</p>
