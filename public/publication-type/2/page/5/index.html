      <div class="article-style">
        
          This study examined how workers at non-governmental organizations must manage their emotions as part of their job - such as staying calm during crises, maintaining professional boundaries with clients, and mentoring new staff while suppressing their own stress. The research found that this "emotional labor" can be both demanding and rewarding for NGO employees who serve vulnerable populations. Understanding emotional labor in NGOs provides important context for policing research, since officers often work alongside these organizations and face similar challenges of managing emotions while serving people in crisis situations.

      <div class="article-style">
        
          Researchers developed a new measurement tool to understand how police officers feel about being monitored by body-worn cameras, finding that officers worry about three main things: losing their ability to make judgment calls, facing public criticism, and having their footage shared widely. Officers who feel more intensely monitored by these cameras experience higher levels of emotional exhaustion and job stress. This research helps police departments better understand how body cameras affect officer wellbeing and job performance, which is crucial for making smart decisions about camera policies.

          Researchers analyzed prosecution decisions across Florida counties and found that filing charges quickly and resolving cases swiftly reduced crime rates more effectively than pursuing harsher punishments. The study shows that the speed and certainty of consequences matter more than severity for deterring crime at the community level. These findings suggest that prosecutors play a crucial role in crime prevention by ensuring swift and reliable responses to criminal behavior, which complements traditional policing efforts.

      <h2><a href="/publication/w2903969786/" >Is Emotional Labor Easier in Collectivist or Individualist Cultures? An East–West Comparison</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          Police officers and other public servants must constantly manage their emotions on the job—staying calm with difficult people, showing empathy with victims, and suppressing frustration—but new research shows this emotional effort is less stressful for workers in cultures that emphasize group harmony over individual needs. Comparing public servants from Eastern and Western countries, researchers found that managing emotions actually reduced burnout among workers in collectivist cultures, while it increased stress for those in individualistic cultures like the United States. This finding suggests that emotional training and support programs for police officers may need to be tailored differently depending on cultural context, as officers from different backgrounds may experience the psychological demands of their job in fundamentally different ways.

      <h2><a href="/publication/w2857679761/" >Police Body-Worn Cameras: Effects on Officers’ Burnout and Perceived Organizational Support</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          A study of 271 police officers found that wearing body cameras increases officer burnout and makes them feel less supported by their departments, likely because the cameras create a sense of constant surveillance at work. However, when police departments actively work to support their officers, this can reduce the negative effects of body camera programs. This research is important because it shows that body cameras don't just affect police interactions with the public—they also impact officer well-being, which departments need to consider when implementing these technologies.

      <h2><a href="/publication/w2892116713/" >“That’s What the Money’s for”: Alienation and Emotional Labor in Public Service</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          This research finds that public employees like police officers can become emotionally burned out when they're required to manage their feelings and interactions with the public without adequate organizational support. When officers become alienated from their work, they may unconsciously transmit negative emotions to community members, who can sense when interactions feel fake or forced, leading to greater distrust of police. This matters for policing because it suggests that police departments need better support systems for officers' emotional wellbeing to prevent a cycle where officer burnout damages police-community relationships.

      <h2><a href="/publication/w2774954674/" >Visibility is a Trap: The Ethics of Police Body-Worn Cameras and Control</a></h2>
      <div class="article-style">
        
          While police body cameras are promoted as tools to increase transparency and accountability, they create serious privacy risks that policymakers haven't fully considered, especially for vulnerable victims of domestic and sexual violence who may be recorded during traumatic moments. The research warns that surveillance technologies often expand beyond their original purpose and become tools of control rather than accountability, particularly when laws and regulations fail to keep pace with how the technology is actually used. This matters because it challenges the common assumption that more police surveillance automatically leads to better policing, highlighting the need for stronger ethical guidelines to protect victims' privacy and dignity.
