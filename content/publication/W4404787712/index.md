abstract: Police resignations increased by 279% following the George Floyd protests,
  posing significant challenges for police staffing and operational capacity. Retirements
  and involuntary separations (e.g., terminations due to misconduct) did not show
  significant changes, but the elevated resignations are likely to continue. Effective
  strategies to improve organizational justice (i.e., perceptions of fair treatment
  of individuals within an organization) and support for officers are crucial to addressing
  the retention crisis. Follow-up studies support the idea of a policing workforce
  crisis and its negative effect on agencies’ abilities to serve communities.
summary: Police resignations surged by 279% after the George Floyd protests in 2020,
  while retirements and firings remained steady, creating a staffing crisis that continues
  today. This massive wave of voluntary departures is undermining police departments'
  ability to serve their communities effectively. The findings suggest that improving
  how officers are treated within their organizations and providing better support
  could help address this ongoing retention problem.

## Abstract

Police resignations increased by 279% following the George Floyd protests, posing significant challenges for police staffing and operational capacity. Retirements and involuntary separations (e.g., terminations due to misconduct) did not show significant changes, but the elevated resignations are likely to continue. Effective strategies to improve organizational justice (i.e., perceptions of fair treatment of individuals within an organization) and support for officers are crucial to addressing the retention crisis. Follow-up studies support the idea of a policing workforce crisis and its negative effect on agencies’ abilities to serve communities.
