      <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://action.aclu.org/signup/free-future-newsletter"><strong><em>Subscribe to the Free Future Newsletter</em></strong></a><br /> <em><a href="http://www.aclu.org/freefuture">Free Future home</a></em></p> <p><em>Pictured above: city council members in Oak Park Village, Illinois debating license plate readers (photo by Paul Goyette)</em></p> <p>The company Flock, which sells participation in a nationwide license plate reader network as well as <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/flock-roundup">other surveillance </a>technology, has been under a lot of pressure lately as increasing numbers of Americans <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/flock-pushback">realize</a> they don’t like the mass surveillance the company sells or its use in the Trump Administration’s war on immigrants. That pressure seems to be resulting in demagogic attacks on the motives of its critics, with the CEO saying they want to “normalize lawlessness” and “weaken public safety.”</p> <p>As we have been <a href="https://www.aclu.org/publications/protecting-privacy-aerial-surveillance-recommendations-government-use-drone-aircraft">saying</a> for <a href="https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/uploads/publications/flock_1.pdf">years</a>, the creation of a giant automated infrastructure for the surveillance of drivers’ comings and goings raises a lot of profound issues — about the balance of power between government and the governed, how much power we should grant the government to investigate and prevent crime, how much privacy we should allow people to have in their public movements over time and space, the psychological, practical, and political effects of a diminishment of such privacy — and ultimately, what will best give people in this country a shot at living happy and fulfilling lives free of domination by others.</p> <p>Americans disagree about how to weigh those values, with some concluding that they want license plate scanning technology in the hands of the police agencies that are supposed to serve them. That kind of disagreement is inevitable in a democratic society.</p> <p>Flock, however, apparently doesn’t credit its critics with good faith or rational desires.</p> <p>In a December <a href="https://www.ci.staunton.va.us/home/showpublisheddocument/13448/639017375545785368">email</a> <a href="https://cvillerightnow.com/news/208802-flock-ceo-includes-charlottesville-staunton-in-email-blaming-activists-for-cities-dropping-the-companys-services/">reportedly</a> sent to all its law enforcement clients, CEO Garrett Langley claimed that attacks on Flock were attacks on law enforcement. “Let's call this what it is,” he wrote. “Flock, and the law enforcement agencies we partner with, are under coordinated attack.” Langley then portrays Flock’s critics as motivated not by legitimate disagreement over the relative importance of different values and the role of mass surveillance in a brutal mass deportation effort, but as some kind of nihilists who wish to destroy society:</p> <blockquote><p>The attacks aren't new. You've been dealing with this for forever, and we've been dealing with this since our founding, from the same activist groups who want to defund the police, weaken public safety, and normalize lawlessness. Now, they're producing YouTube videos with misleading headlines.</p></blockquote> <p>Langley also told police departments that “activist groups” are also “trying to turn a public records process into a weapon against you and against us.” In a democratic society where sovereignty rests with the people, transparency into what the government is doing is vital. In an era where powerful new technologies promise to give the government expansive new powers never before seen in human history, transparency becomes even more urgent.</p> <p>Last week, responding to <a href="https://www.404media.co/police-unmask-millions-of-surveillance-targets-because-of-flock-redaction-error/">critical coverage</a> of the release of data on millions of police surveillance targets by reporters at 404Media, Flock <a href="https://www.404media.co/police-unmask-millions-of-surveillance-targets-because-of-flock-redaction-error/#:~:text=activists%20trying%20to%20let%20murderers%20go%20free">charged</a> that behind the criticism lay “activists trying to let murderers go free.”</p> <p>C’mon, Flock — seriously? Are you really saying that a desire to “see murderers go free” and “normalize lawlessness” is what’s motivating privacy advocates, residents, city council members, and people exercising their First Amendment rights who are dealing with <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/free-speech/photographer-retaliation-foia">retaliation</a> by federal agents, including those <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2026/01/13/ice-using-private-data-to-intimidate-observers-and-activists-advocates-say">abusing license plate databases for non-law enforcement purposes</a> by tapping into them to drive to observers’ homes in order to intimidate them?</p> <p>Ironically, if there is anyone who does want those things right now, it is those participating in Trump’s deportation drive, which has come closer to “normalizing lawlessness” than anything we have seen in this nation in a long time. Langley might be better off aiming his criticism toward some of his financial backers like Mark Andreessen, whose venture capital firm A16Z has been an <a href="https://ipvm.com/reports/flock-150-a16z">early</a> and <a href="https://techstartups.com/2025/03/13/flock-safety-raises-275m-from-andreessen-horowitz-to-expand-drone-manufacturing-and-crime-fighting-tech/">significant</a> investor in Flock and other surveillance companies — and who has also been a supporter of the man pushing the federal lawlessness we’re seeing on the streets of American cities today: President Trump.</p> <p>To their credit, at least some recipients of Flock’s letter responded with consummate professionalism. Staunton, Virginia police chief Jim Williams, who released the Flock email, wrote back to <a href="https://www.ci.staunton.va.us/home/showpublisheddocument/13448/639017375545785368">rebuke</a> Langley:</p> <blockquote><p>As far as your assertion that we are currently under attack, I do not believe that this is so…. What we are seeing here is a group of local citizens who are raising concerns that we could be potentially surveilling private citizens, residents and visitors and using the data for nefarious purposes. These citizens have been exercising their rights to receive answers from me, my staff, and city officials, to include our elected leaders. ln short, it is democracy in action.</p></blockquote> <p>In Charlottesville, VA, the police chief <a href="https://cvillerightnow.com/news/208802-flock-ceo-includes-charlottesville-staunton-in-email-blaming-activists-for-cities-dropping-the-companys-services/">reacted similarly</a>, telling a local news outlet that “people have a right to disagree and have issues with things,” and that “at the end of the day communities get to have a say on how they want to be policed.”</p> <p>In its earlier years Flock implicitly accepted the importance of privacy, emphasizing (though <a href="https://www.aclu.org/wp-content/uploads/publications/flock_1.pdf">exaggerating</a>) certain privacy-protective limits in its license plate recognition product. Now, apparently, the company has adopted the attitude that, in essence, if you are concerned at all about mass surveillance and limiting the power of law enforcement, you support criminals. It is a simplistic, juvenile, and ultimately authoritarian stance.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden"><div class="field__items"><div class="field__item even"><p><span>The Baton Rouge Police Department announced this week that it will begin using </span><a href="https://sls.eff.org/technologies/drones-and-robots"><span>a drone</span></a><span> designed by military equipment manufacturer Lockheed Martin and Edge Autonomy, making it one of the first local police departments to use an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with a history of primary use in foreign war zones. Baton Rouge is now one of the first local police departments in the United States to deploy an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with such extensive surveillance capabilities — a dangerous escalation in the militarization of local law enforcement.</span></p> <p><span>This is a troubling development in an already long history of local law enforcement acquiring and utilizing military-grade surveillance equipment. It should be a cautionary tale that prods communities across the country to be proactive in ensuring that drones can only be acquired and used in ways that are well-documented, transparent, and subject to public feedback. </span></p> <p><span>Baton Rouge bought the </span><a href="https://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/aero/documents/Stalker/StalkerVXE30ProductCard.pdf"><span>Stalker VXE30</span></a><span> from Edge Autonomy, which partners with </span><a href="https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/products/stalker.html"><span>Lockheed Martin</span></a> <span>and began </span><a href="https://rdw.com/newsroom/redwire-announces-sunsetting-of-edge-autonomy-brand-and-new-organizational-structure-to-align-with-market-opportunities-for-accelerated-growth/"><span>operating under the brand Redwire this week</span></a><span>.

      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/01/how-hackers-are-fighting-back-against-ice</guid>

      <description><![CDATA[ICE has been invading U.S. cities, targeting, surveilling, harassing, assaulting, detaining, and torturing people who are undocumented immigrants. They also have targeted people with work permits, asylum seekers, permanent residents (people holding “green cards”), naturalized citizens, and even citizens by birth. ICE has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on surveillance technology to spy on anyone—and potentially everyone—in the United States. It can be hard to imagine how to defend oneself against such an overwhelming force. But a few enterprising hackers have started projects to do counter surveillance against ICE, and hopefully protect their communities through clever use of technology. Let’s start with Flock, the company behind a number of automated license plate reader (ALPR) and other camera technologies. You might be surprised at how many Flock cameras there are in your community. Many large and small municipalities around the country have signed deals with Flock for license plate readers to track the movement of all cars in their city. Even though these deals are signed by local police departments, oftentimes ICE also gains access. Because of their ubiquity, people are interested in finding out where and how many Flock cameras are in their community. One project that can help with this is the OUI-SPY, a small piece of open source hardware. The OUI-SPY runs on a cheap Arduino compatible chip called an ESP-32. There are multiple programs available for loading on the chip, such as “Flock You,” which allows people to detect Flock cameras and “Sky-Spy” to detect overhead drones. There’s also “BLE Detect,” which detects various Bluetooth signals including ones from Axon, Meta’s Ray-Bans that secretly record you, and more. It also has a mode commonly known as “fox hunting” to track down a specific device. Activists and researchers can use this tool to map out different technologies and quantify the spread of surveillance. There’s also the open source Wigle app which is primarily designed for mapping out Wi-Fi, but also has the ability to make an audio alert when a specific Wi-Fi or Bluetooth identifier is detected. This means you can set it up to get a notification when it detects products from Flock, Axon, or other nasties in their vicinity. One enterprising YouTuber, Benn Jordan, figured out a way to fool Flock cameras into not recording his license plate simply by painting some minor visual noise on his license plate. This is innocuous enough that any human will still be able to read his license plate, but it completely prevented Flock devices from recognizing his license plate as a license plate at the time. Some states have outlawed drivers obscuring their license plates, so taking such action is not recommended. Jordan later went on to discover hundreds of misconfigured Flock cameras that were exposing their administrator interface without a password on the public internet. This would allow anyone with an internet connection to view a live surveillance feed, download 30 days of video, view logs, and more. The cameras pointed at parks, public trails, busy intersections, and even a playground. This was a massive breach of public trust and a huge mistake for a company that claims to be working for public safety.Other hackers have taken on the task of open-source intelligence and community reporting. One interesting example is deflock.me and alpr.watch, which are crowdsourced maps of ALPR cameras. Much like the OUI-SPY project, this allows activists to map out and expose Flock surveillance cameras in their community. There have also been several ICE reporting apps released, including apps to report ICE sightings in your area such Stop ICE Alerts, ICEOUT.org, and ICE Block. ICEBlock was delisted by Apple at the request of Attorney General Pam Bondi, a fact we are suing over. There is also Eyes Up, an app to securely record and archive ICE raids, which was taken down by Apple earlier this year. Another interesting project documenting ICE and creating a trove of open-source intelligence is ICE List Wiki which contains info on companies that have contracts with ICE, incidents and encounters with ICE, and vehicles ICE uses. People without programming knowledge can also get involved. In Chicago, people used whistles to warn their neighbors that ICE was present or in the area. Many people 3D-printed whistles along with instructional booklets to hand out to their communities, allowing a wider distribution of whistles and consequently earlier warnings for their neighbors. Many hackers have started hosting digital security trainings for their communities or building web sites with security advice, including how to remove your data from the watchful eyes of the surveillance industry. To reach a broader community, trainers have even started hosting trainings on how to defend their communities and what to do in an ICE raid in video games, such as Fortnight. There is also EFF’s own Rayhunter project for detecting cell-site simulators, about which we have written extensively. Rayhunter runs on a cheap mobile hotspot and doesn’t require deep technical knowledge to use.It’s important to remember that we are not powerless. Even in the face of a domestic law enforcement presence with massive surveillance capabilities and military-esque technologies, there are still ways to engage in surveillance self-defense. We cannot give into nihilism and fear. We must continue to find small ways to protect ourselves and our communities, and when we can, fight back. EFF is not affiliated with any of these projects (other than Rayhunter) and does not endorse them. We don’t make any statements about the legality of using any of these projects. Please consult with an attorney to determine what risks there may be. Related Cases:&nbsp;EFF v. DOJ, DHS (ICE tracking apps)]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has a new budget under the current administration, and they are going on a surveillance tech shopping spree. Standing at $28.7 billion dollars for the year 2025 (nearly triple their 2024 budget) and at least another $56.25 billion over the next three years, ICE's budget would be the envy of many national militaries around the world. Indeed, this budget would put ICE as the 14th most well-funded military in the world, right between Ukraine and Israel. There are many different agencies under U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that deal with immigration, as well as non-immigration related agencies such as Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). ICE is specifically the enforcement arm of the U.S. immigration apparatus. Their stated mission is to “[p]rotect America through criminal investigations and enforcing immigration laws to preserve national security and public safety.” Of course, ICE doesn’t just end up targeting, surveilling, harassing, assaulting, detaining, and torturing people who are undocumented immigrants. They have targeted people on work permits, asylum seekers, permanent residents (people holding “green cards”), naturalized citizens, and even citizens by birth. While the NSA and FBI might be the first agencies that come to mind when thinking about surveillance in the U.S., ICE should not be discounted. ICE has always engaged in surveillance and intelligence-gathering as part of their mission. A 2022 report by Georgetown Law’s Center for Privacy and Technology found the following:ICE had scanned the driver’s license photos of 1 in 3 adults.ICE had access to the driver’s license data of 3 in 4 adults.ICE was tracking the movements of drivers in cities home to 3 in 4 adults.ICE could locate 3 in 4 adults through their utility records.ICE built its surveillance dragnet by tapping data from private companies and state and local bureaucracies.ICE spent approximately $2.8 billion between 2008 and 2021 on new surveillance, data collection and data-sharing programs. With a budget for 2025 that is 10 times the size of the agency’s total surveillance spending over the last 13 years, ICE is going on a shopping spree, creating one of the largest, most comprehensive domestic surveillance machines in history. How We Got HereThe entire surveillance industry has been allowed to grow and flourish under both Democratic and Republican regimes. For example, President Obama dramatically expanded ICE from its more limited origins, while at the same time narrowing its focus to undocumented people accused of crimes. Under the first and second Trump administrations, ICE ramped up its operations significantly, increasing raids in major cities far from the southern border and casting a much wider net on potential targets. ICE has most recently expanded its partnerships with sheriffs across the U.S., and deported more than 1.5 million people cumulatively under the Trump administrations (600,000 of those were just during the first year of Trump’s second term according to DHS statistics), not including the 1.6 million people DHS claims have “self-deported.” More horrifying is that in just the last year of the current administration, 4,250 people detained by ICE have gone missing, and 31 have died in custody or while being detained. In contrast, 24 people died in ICE custody during the entirety of the Biden administration.ICE also has openly stated that they plan to spy on the American public, looking for any signs of left-wing dissent against their domestic military-like presence. Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said in a recent interview that his agency “was dedicated to the mission of going after” Antifa and left-wing gun clubs. On a long enough timeline, any surveillance tool you build will eventually be used by people you don’t like for reasons that you disagree with.On a long enough timeline, any surveillance tool you build will eventually be used by people you don’t like for reasons that you disagree with. A surveillance-industrial complex and a democratic society are fundamentally incompatible, regardless of your political party. EFF recently published a guide to using government databases to dig up homeland security spending and compiled our own dataset of companies selling tech to DHS components. In 2025, ICE entered new contracts with several private companies for location surveillance, social media surveillance, face surveillance, spyware, and phone surveillance. Let’s dig into each.Phone Surveillance Tools One common surveillance tactic of immigration officials is to get physical access to a person’s phone, either while the person is detained at a border crossing, or while they are under arrest. ICE renewed an $11 million contract with a company called Cellebrite, which helps ICE unlock phones and then can take a complete image of all the data on the phone, including apps, location history, photos, notes, call records, text messages, and even Signal and WhatsApp messages. ICE also signed a $3 million contract with Cellebrite’s main competitor Magnet Forensics, makers of the Graykey device for unlocking phones. DHS has had contracts with Cellebrite since 2008, but the number of phones they search has risen dramatically each year, reaching a new high of 14,899 devices searched by ICE’s sister agency U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) between April and June of 2025. If ICE can’t get physical access to your phone, that won’t stop them from trying to gain access to your data. They have also resumed a $2 million contract with the spyware manufacturer, Paragon. Paragon makes the Graphite spyware, which made headlines in 2025 for being found on the phones of several dozen members of Italian civil society. Graphite is able to harvest messages from multiple different encrypted chat apps such as Signal and WhatsApp without the user ever knowing. Our concern with ICE buying this software is the likelihood that it will be used against undocumented people and immigrants who are here legally, as well as U.S. citizens who have spoken up against ICE or who work with immigrant communities. Malware such as Graphite can be used to read encrypted messages as they are sent, other forms of spyware can also download files, photos, location history, record phone calls, and even discretely turn on your microphone to record you. How to Protect Yourself The most effective way to protect yourself from smartphone surveillance would be to not have a phone. But that’s not realistic advice in modern society. Fortunately, for most people there are other ways you can make it harder for ICE to spy on your digital life. The first and easiest step is to keep your phone up to date. Installing security updates makes it harder to use malware against you and makes it less likely for Cellebrite to break into your phone. Likewise, both iPhone (Lockdown Mode) and Android (Advanced Protection) offer special modes that lock your phone down and can help protect against some malware.The first and easiest step is to keep your phone up to date. Having your phone’s software up to date and locked with a strong alphanumeric password will offer some protection against Cellebrite, depending on your model of phone. However, the strongest protection is simply to keep your phone turned off, which puts it in “before first unlock” mode and has been typically harder for law enforcement to bypass. This is good to do if you are at a protest and expect to be arrested, if you are crossing a border, or if you are expecting to encounter ICE. Keeping your phone on airplane mode should be enough to protect against cell-site simulators, but turning your phone off will offer extra protection against cell-site simulators and Cellebrite devices. If you aren’t able to turn your phone off, it’s a good idea to at least turn off face/fingerprint unlock to make it harder for police to force you to unlock your phone. While EFF continues to fight to strengthen our legal protections against compelling people to decrypt their devices, there is currently less protection against compelled face and fingerprint unlocking than there is against compelled password disclosure.Internet Surveillance ICE has also spent $5 million to acquire at least two location and social media surveillance tools: Webloc and Tangles, from a company called Pen Link, an established player in the open source intelligence space. Webloc gathers the locations of millions of phones by gathering data from mobile data brokers and linking it together with other information about users. Tangles is a social media surveillance tool which combines web scraping with access to social media application programming interfaces. These tools are able to build a dossier on anyone who has a public social media account. Tangles is able to link together a person’s posting history, posts, and comments containing keywords, location history, tags, social graph, and photos with those of their friends and family. Penlink then sells this information to law enforcement, allowing law enforcement to avoid the need for a warrant. This means ICE can look up historic and current locations of many people all across the U.S. without ever having to get a warrant.These tools are able to build a dossier on anyone who has a public social media account.ICE also has established contracts with other social media scanning and AI analysis companies, such as a $4.2 million contract with a company called Fivecast for the social media surveillance and AI analysis tool ONYX. According to Fivecast, ONYX can conduct “automated, continuous and targeted collection of multimedia data” from all major “news streams, search engines, social media, marketplaces, the dark web, etc.” ONYX can build what it calls “digital footprints” from biographical data and curated datasets spanning numerous platforms, and “track shifts in sentiment and emotion” and identify the level of risk associated with an individual. Another contract is with ShadowDragon for their product Social Net, which is able to monitor publicly available data from over 200 websites. In an acquisition document from 2022, ICE confirmed that ShadowDragon allowed the agency to search “100+ social networking sites,” noting that “[p]ersistent access to Facebook and Twitter provided by ShadowDragon SocialNet is of the utmost importance as they are the most prominent social media platforms.”ICE has also indicated that they intend to spend between 20 and 50 million dollars on building and staffing a 24/7 social media monitoring office with at least 30 full time agents to comb every major social media website for leads that could generate enforcement raids. How to protect yourself For U.S. citizens, making your account private on social media is a good place to start. You might also consider having accounts under a pseudonym, or deleting your social media accounts altogether. For more information, check out our guide to protecting yourself on social media. Unfortunately, people immigrating to the U.S. might be subject to greater scrutiny, including mandatory social media checks, and should consult with an immigration attorney before taking any action. For people traveling to the U.S., new rules will soon likely require them to reveal five years of social media history and 10 years of past email addresses to immigration officials. Street-Level Surveillance But it’s not just your digital habits ICE wants to surveil; they also want to spy on you in the physical world. ICE has contracts with multiple automated license plate reader (ALPR) companies and is able to follow the driving habits of a large percentage of Americans. ICE uses this data to track down specific people anywhere in the country. ICE has a $6 million contract through a Thomson Reuters subsidiary to access ALPR data from Motorola Solutions. ICE has also persuaded local law enforcement officers to run searches on their behalf through Flock Safety's massive network of ALPR data. CBP, including Border Patrol, also operates a network of covert ALPR systems in many areas. ICE has also invested in biometric surveillance tools, such as face recognition software called Mobile Fortify to scan the faces of people they stop to determine if they are here legally. Mobile Fortify checks the pictures it takes against a database of 200 million photos for a match (the source of the photos is unknown). Additionally, ICE has a $10 million contract with Clearview AI for face recognition. ICE has also contracted with iris scanning company BI2 technologies for even more invasive biometric surveillance. ICE agents have also been spotted wearing Meta’s Ray-Ban video recording sunglasses. ICE has acquired trucks equipped with cell-site simulators (AKA Stingrays) from a company called TechOps Specialty Vehicles (likely the cell-site simulators were manufactured by another company). This is not the first time ICE has bought this technology. According to documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union, ICE deployed cell-site simulators at least 466 times between 2017 and 2019, and ICE more than 1,885 times between 2013 and 2017, according to documents obtained by BuzzFeed News. Cell-site simulators can be used to track down a specific person in real time, with more granularity than a phone company or tools like Webloc can provide, though Webloc has the distinct advantage of being used without a warrant and not requiring agents to be in the vicinity of the person being tracked. How to protect yourself Taking public transit or bicycling is a great way to keep yourself off ALPR databases, but an even better way is to go to your local city council meetings and demand the city cancels contracts with ALPR companies, like people have done in Flagstaff, Arizona; Eugene, Oregon; and Denver, Colorado, among others. If you are at a protest, putting your phone on airplane mode could help protect you from cell-site simulators and from apps on your phone disclosing your location, but might leave you vulnerable to advanced targeted attacks. For more advanced protection, turning your phone completely off protects against all radio based attacks, and also makes it harder for tools like Cellebrite to break into your phone as discussed above. But each individual will need to weigh their need for security from advanced radio based attacks against their need to document potential abuses through photo or video. For more information about protecting yourself at a protest, head over to SSD.There is nothing you can do to change your face, which is why we need more stringent privacy laws such as Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act.Tying All the Data Together Last but not least, ICE uses tools to combine and search all this data along with the data on Americans they have acquired from private companies, the IRS, TSA, and other government databases. To search all this data, ICE uses ImmigrationOS, a system that came from a $30-million contract with Palantir. What Palantir does is hard to explain, even for people who work there, but essentially they are plumbers. Palantir makes it so that ICE has all the data they have acquired in one place so it’s easy to search through. Palantir links data from different databases, like IRS data, immigration records, and private databases, and enables ICE to view all of this data about a specific person in one place. Palantir makes it so that ICE has all the data they have acquired in one place so it’s easy to search through. The true civil liberties nightmare of Palantir is that they enable governments to link data that should have never been linked. There are good civil liberties reasons why IRS data was never linked with immigration data and was never linked with social media data, but Palantir breaks those firewalls. Palantir has labeled themselves as a progressive, human rights centric company historically, but their recent actions have given them away as just another tech company enabling surveillance nightmares.Threat Modeling When ICE Is Your Adversary Understanding the capabilities and limits of ICE and how to threat model helps you and your community fight back, remain powerful, and protect yourself.One of the most important things you can do is to not spread rumors and misinformation. Rumors like “ICE has malware so now everyone's phones are compromised” or “Palantir knows what you are doing all the time” or “Signal is broken” don’t help your community. It’s more useful to spread facts, ways to protect yourself, and ways to fight back. For information about how to create a security plan for yourself or your community, and other tips to protect yourself, read our Surveillance Self-Defense guides.How EFF Is Fighting BackOne way to fight back against ICE is in the courts. EFF currently has a lawsuit against ICE over their pressure on Apple and Google to take down ICE spotting apps, like ICEBlock. We also represent multiple labor unions suing ICE over their social media surveillance practices. We have also demanded the San Francisco Police Department stop sharing data illegally with ICE, and issued a statement condemning the collaboration between ICE and the malware provider Paragon. We also continue to maintain our Rayhunter project for detecting cell-site simulators. Other civil liberties organizations are also suing ICE. ACLU has sued ICE over a subpoena to Meta attempting to identify the owner of an account providing advice to protestors, and another coalition of groups has thus far successfully sued the IRS to stop sharing taxpayer data with ICE. We need to have a hard look at the surveillance industry. It is a key enabler of vast and untold violations of human rights and civil liberties, and it continues to be used by aspiring autocrats to threaten our very democracy. As long as it exists, the surveillance industry, and the data it generates, will be an irresistible tool for anti-democratic forces.Related Cases:&nbsp;EFF v.

      <description><![CDATA[<div class="field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden"><div class="field__items"><div class="field__item even"><p><em>This guide was co-written by Andrew Zuker with support from the Heinrich Boell Foundation.</em></p> <p><span>The U.S. government publishes volumes of detailed data on the money it spends, but searching through it and finding information can be challenging. Complex search functions and poor user interfaces on government reporting sites can hamper an investigation, as can inconsistent company profiles and complex corporate ownership structures. </span></p> <p><span>This week, EFF and the Heinrich Boell Foundation released an update to our database of vendors providing technology to components of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protections (CBP). It includes new vendor profiles, new fields, and updated data on top contractors, so that journalists and researchers have a jumping-off point for their own investigations. </span></p> <p>Access the dataset through <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X9fnHvjX7RCCiDOX5KzKLrcXFMz1L_Pe/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=100791728394017446240&rtpof=true&sd=true">Google Sheets</a> (Google's <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US">Privacy Policy</a> applies) or download the Excel file <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/us-border-homeland-security-tech-vendors-dataset">here</a>. </p> <p><span>This time we thought we would also share some of the research methods we developed while assembling this dataset.</span></p> <p><span>This guide covers the key databases that store information on federal spending and contracts (often referred to as "awards"), government solicitations for products and services, and the government's "online shopping superstore," plus a few other deep-in-the-weeds datasets buried in the online bureaucracy. We have provided a step-by-step guide for searching these sites efficiently and help tips for finding information. While we have written this specifically with DHS agencies in mind, it should serve as a useful resource for procurement across the federal government. </span></p> <h2><br /><span>1. Procurement Sites: <a href="http://fpds.gov"><span>FPDS.gov</span><span> and </span></a><a href="http://usaspending.com"><span>USASpending.Com</span><span> </span></a></span></h2> <h3><span>Federal Procurement Data System - </span><a href="http://fpds.gov"><span>fpds.gov</span><span></span></a></h3> <p><span>The Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) is the best place to start for finding out what companies are working with DHS. It is the official system for tracking federal discretionary spending and contains current data on contracts with non-governmental entities like corporations and private businesses. Award data is up-to-date and includes detailed information on vendors and awards which can be helpful when searching the other systems. It is a little bit old-school, but that often makes it one of the easiest and quickest sites to search, once you get the hang of it, since it offers a lot of options for narrowing search parameters to specific agencies, vendors, classification of services, etc. </span></p> <p><b>How to Use FDPS</b><span><br />To begin searching Awards for a particular vendor, click into the “ezSearch” field in the center of the page, delete or replace the text “Google-like search to help you find federal contracts…” with a vendor name or keywords, and hit Enter to begin a new search. </span></p> <p><span><img alt="The EZ Search landing page for FPDS.gov" height="813" src="https://www.eff.org/files/2025/12/22/fpdslanding_0.png" title="The EZ Search landing page for FPDS.gov" width="1998" /></span></p> <p><span>A new tab will open automatically with exact matches at the top. </span></p> <p><span><img alt="A page of results for Google's contracts with the federal government." height="2021" src="https://www.eff.org/files/2025/12/22/fpdsresults.png" title="A page of results for Google's contracts with the federal government." width="3584" /></span></p> <p><span>Four “Top 10” modules on the left side of the page link to top results in descending order: Department Full Name, Contracting Agency Name, Full Legal Business Name, and Treasury Account Symbol. These ranked lists help the user quickly narrow in on departments and agencies that vendors do business with. DHS may not appear in the “Top 10” results, which may indicate that the vendor hasn’t yet been awarded DHS or subagency contracts.</span></p> <p><span>For example, if you searched the term “FLIR”, as in Teledyne FLIR who make infrared surveillance systems used along the U.S.-Mexico border, DHS is the 2nd result in the “Top 10: Department Full Name” box. </span></p> <p><span><img alt="FDPS.gov results for FLIR with the agency full name sidebar highlighted." height="1594" src="https://www.eff.org/files/2025/12/22/fpdstop10boxes.png" title="FDPS.gov results for FLIR with the agency full name sidebar highlighted." width="2494" /></span></p> <p><span>To see all DHS contracts awarded to the vendor, click “Homeland Security, Department of” from the “Top 10 Department Full Name” module. When the page loads, you will see the subcomponents of DHS (e.g., ICE, CBP, or the U.S. Secret Service) in the lefthand menu. You can click on each of those to drill down even further. You can also drill down by choosing a company. </span></p> <p><span>Sorting options can be found on the right side of the page which offer the ability to refine and organize search results. One of the most useful is "Date Signed," which will arrange the results in chronological order. </span></p> <p><span><img alt="FPDS.gov results for FLIR with the sort by sidebar highlighted" height="828" src="https://www.eff.org/files/2025/12/22/fpds.gov_sort_by.png" title="FPDS.gov results for FLIR with the sort by sidebar highlighted" width="1270" /></span></p> <p><span>You don't have to search by a company name. You can also use a product keyword, such as "LPR" (license plate reader). However, because keywords are not consistently used by government agencies, you will need to try various permutations to gather the most data. </span></p> <p><span>Each click or search filter adds a new term to the search both in the main field at the top and in the Search Criteria module on the right. They can be deleted by clicking the X next to the term in this module or by removing the text in the main search field.</span></p> <p><span><img alt="FPDS.gov results with the sidebar for deselecting terms highlighted with an arrow." height="755" src="https://www.eff.org/files/2025/12/22/fpdscriteria.png" title="FPDS.gov results with the sidebar for deselecting terms highlighted with an arrow." width="2854" /></span></p> <p><span>For each contract item, you can click "View" to see the specific details. However, these pages don't have permalinks, so you'll want to print-to-pdf if you need to retain a permanent copy of the record. </span></p> <p><span>Often the vendor brand name we know from their marketing or news media is not the same entity that is awarded government contracts. Foreign companies in particular rely on partnerships with domestic entities that are established federal contractors. If you can’t find any spending records for a vendor, search the web for information on the company including acquisitions, partnerships, licensing agreements, parent companies, and subsidiaries. It is likely that one of these types of related companies is the contract holder. </span></p> <h3><span>USA Spending - </span><a href="http://usaspending.gov"><span>usaspending.gov</span></a></h3> <p><span>The Federal Funding and Accountability Act (FFATA) of 2006 and the DATA Act of 2014 require the government to publish all spending records and contracts on a single, searchable public website, including agency-specific contracts, using unified reporting standards to ensure consistent, reliable, searchable data. This led to the creation of USA Spending (</span><a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/about"><span>usaspending.gov</span></a><span>). </span></p> <p><span>USA Spending is populated with data from multiple sources including the Federal Procurement Data System (</span><a href="http://fpds.gov"><span>fpds.gov</span></a><span>) and the System for Awards Management (</span><a href="http://sam.gov"><span>sam.gov</span></a><span> - which we'll discuss in the next section). It also compiles Treasury Reports and data from the financial systems of dozens of federal agencies. We relied heavily on Awards data from these systems to verify vendor information including contracts with the DHS and its subagencies such as CBP and ICE. </span></p> <p><span>USA Spending has a more modern interface, but is often very slow with the information often hidden in expandable menus. In many ways it is duplicative of FPDS, but with more features, including the ability to bookmark individual pages. We often found ourselves using FPDS to quickly identify data, and then using the "Award ID" number to find the specific record within USA Spending. </span></p> <p><span>USA Spending also has some visualizations and ways to analyze data in chart form, which is not possible with the largely text-based FPDS. </span></p> <p><b>How to Use USA Spending</b></p> <p><span>To begin searching for DHS awards, click on either “Search Award Data” on the navigation bar, or the blue “Start Searching Awards”button. </span></p> <p><img alt="The landing page of USA Spending with arrows pointing to the search links." height="1765" src="https://www.eff.org/files/2025/12/22/usaslanding.png" title="The landing page of USA Spending with arrows pointing to the search links." width="3231" /></p> <p><span>On the left of the Search page are a list of drop down menus with options. You can enter a vendor name as a keyword, or expand the “Recipient” menu if you know the full company name or their Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) number. Expand the “Agency Tab” and enter DHS which will bring up the Department of Homeland Security Option.</span></p> <p><img alt="USA Spending page with arrows pointing to the key search filters." height="1942" src="https://www.eff.org/files/2025/12/22/usassearchfilters_0.png" title="USA Spending page with arrows pointing to the key search filters." width="2913" /></p> <p><span>In the example below, we entered “Palantir Technologies” as a keyword, and selected DHS in the Agency dropdown:</span></p> <p><span><img alt="Search results showing Palantir contracts" height="866" src="https://www.eff.org/files/2026/01/05/palantir_usa_spending.png" title="Search results showing Palantir contracts" width="1211" /></span></p> <p><span>For vendors with hundreds of contracts that return many pages of results, consider adding more filters to the search such as a specific time period or specifying a Funding Agency such as ICE or CBP. In this example, the filters “Palantir Technologies” and “DHS” returned 13 results (at the time of publication). It is important to note that the search results table is larger than what displays in that module. You can scroll down to view more Awards and scroll to the right to see much more information. </span></p> <p><span>Scroll down outside of that module to reveal more info including modules for Results by Category, Results over Time, and Results by Geography, all of which can be viewed as a list or graph. </span></p> <p><span><img alt="USA Spending page with graphs and charts" height="2024" src="https://www.eff.org/files/2026/01/05/usasscrolldown.png" title="USA Spending page with graphs and charts" width="1956" /></span></p> <p><span>Once you've identified a contract, you can click the "Prime Award ID" to see the granular details for each time. </span></p> <p><span>From the search, you can also select just the agency to see all the contracts on file. Each agency also has its own page showing a breakdown for every fiscal year of how much money they had to spend and which components spent the most. For example, here's </span><a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/agency/department-of-homeland-security?fy=2025"><span>DHS's page</span></a><span>.</span></p> <h2><span>2. Contracting Opportunities - <a href="http://sam.gov"><span>S</span><span>AM</span><span>.gov</span><span> </span></a></span></h2> <p><span>So far we've talked about how to track contracts and spending, but now let's take a step back and look at how those contracts come to be. The System for Award Management, </span><a href="http://sam.gov"><span>SAM.gov</span></a><span>, is the site that allows companies to see what products and services the government intends to buy so they can bid on the contract. But SAM.gov is also open to the public, which means you can see the same information, including a detailed scope of a project and sometimes even technical details. </span></p> <p><b>How to Use </b><a href="http://sam.gov"><b>Sam.gov</b></a></p> <p><a href="http://sam.gov"><span>SAM.gov</span></a><span> does not require an account for its basic contracting opportunity searches, but you may want to create one in order to save the things you find and to receive keyword- or agency-based alerts via email when new items of interest are posted. </span></p> <p><span>First you will click "Search" in the menu bar, which will bring you to this page: </span><br /><br /></p> <p><img alt="Search page on Sam.gov" height="1306" src="https://www.eff.org/files/2026/01/05/sam.govsearchpage.png" title="Search page on Sam.gov" width="2206" /></p> <p><span>We recommend selecting both "Active" and "Inactive" in the Status menu. Contracts quickly go inactive, and besides, sometimes the contracts you are most interested in are several years old. </span></p> <p><span>If you are researching a particular technology such as unmanned aerial vehicles, you might just type "unmanned" in the Simple Search bar. That will bring up every solicitation with that keyword across the federal government.</span></p> <p><span>One of the most useful features is filtering by agency, while leaving the keyword search blank. This will return a running list of an agency's calls for bids and related procurement activities. It is worth checking regularly. For example, here's what CBP's looks like on a given day: </span></p> <p><span><img alt="Sam.gov results for Customs and Border Patrol" height="772" src="https://www.eff.org/files/2026/01/05/samresults.png" title="Sam.gov results for Customs and Border Patrol" width="932" /></span></p> <p><span>If you click on an item, you should next scroll down to see if there are attachments. These tend to contain the most details. Specifically, you should look for the term "SOW," the abbreviation for "Statement of Work." For example, here are the attachments for a CBP contracting opportunity for "Cellular Covert Cameras": </span></p> <p><span><img alt="Links for attachments" height="307" src="https://www.eff.org/files/2026/01/05/sam.govattachmentslinks.png" title="Links for attachments" width="704" /></span></p> <p><span>The first document is the Statement of Work, which tells you the exact brand, model, and number of devices they want to acquire: </span></p> <p><span><img alt="Line items for hundreds of Hyperfire cameras and related components." height="242" src="https://www.eff.org/files/2026/01/05/sam.govstatementofwork.png" title="Line items for hundreds of Hyperfire cameras and related components." width="875" /></span></p> <p><span>The attachments also included a "BNO Justification." BNO stands for "Brand Name Only," and this document explains in even more detail why CBP wants that specific product:</span></p> <p><span><img alt="Explanation of why the government wants to purchase this particular model of camera." height="250" src="https://www.eff.org/files/2026/01/05/sam.govbnostatement.png" title="Explanation of why the government wants to purchase this particular model of camera." width="1031" /></span></p> <p><span>If you see the terms "Sole Source" in a listing, that also means that an agency has decided that only one product meets its requirements and it will not open bidding to other companies. </span></p> <p><span>In addition to contracting, many agencies announce "Industry Day" events, usually virtual, that members of the public can join. This is a unique opportunity to listen in on what contractors are being told by government purchasing officials. The presentation slides are also often later uploaded to the </span><a href="http://sam.gov"><span>SAM.gov</span></a><span> page. Occasionally, the list of attendees will also be posted, and you'll find several examples of those lists in our dataset.</span></p> <h2><span>3. The Government's "Superstore" - </span><a href="http://gsaadvantage.gov"><span>gsaadvantage.gov</span></a></h2> <p><span>Another way to investigate DHS purchasing is by browsing the catalog of items and services immediately available to them. The General Services Administration operates </span><a href="https://www.gsaadvantage.gov"><span>GSA Advantage</span></a><span>, which it describes as "the government's central online shopping superstore." The website's search is open, allowing members of the public to view any vendors' offerings–including both products and services– easily as they would with any online marketplace. </span></p> <p><span>For example, you could search for "</span><a href="https://www.gsaadvantage.gov/advantage/ws/search/advantage_search?q=0:8license%20plate%20reader&db=0&searchType=0"><span>license plate reader</span></a><span>" and produce a list of available products: </span></p> <p><span><img alt="Search results that show a license plate reader for sale for $995." height="700" src="https://www.eff.org/files/2026/01/05/gsaresultslpr.png" title="Search results that show a license plate reader for sale for $995." width="1199" /></span></p> <p><span>If you click "Advanced Search," you can also isolate every product available from a particular manufacturer. For example, here are the </span><a href="https://www.gsaadvantage.gov/advantage/ws/search/advantage_search?q=10:1skydio&s=0&searchType=1&c=25"><span>results</span></a><span> when you search for products available from Skydio, a drone manufacturer.</span></p> <p><span><img alt="Search results for 50 Skydio drone-related products" height="938" src="https://www.eff.org/files/2026/01/05/gsaproducts.png" title="Search results for 50 Skydio drone-related products" width="1515" /></span></p> <p><span>If you switch from "Products" to "Services" you can export datasets for each company about their offerings. For example, if you search for "Palantir" you'll get results that look like </span><a href="https://www.gsaadvantage.gov/advantage/ws/search/advantage_search?q=0:8palantir&db=1&searchType=2"><span>this</span></a><span>:</span></p> <p><img alt="Search results with companies offering Palantir-related services." height="932" src="https://www.eff.org/files/2026/01/05/gsaservices.png" title="Search results with companies offering Palantir-related services." width="1503" /></p> <p><span>This means all these companies are offering some sort of Palantir-related services. If you click "Matches found in Terms and Conditions," you'll download a PDF with a lot of details about what the company offers. </span></p> <p><span>For example, here's a a screengrab from </span><a href="https://www.gsaadvantage.gov/ref_text/47QTCA25D009R/10Q3TZ.3WGGON_47QTCA25D009R_47QTCA25D009RPRICELIST20250925.PDF"><span>Anduril's documentation</span></a><span>: </span></p> <p><img alt="A menu of surveillance towers with prices." height="837" src="https://www.eff.org/files/2026/01/05/gsaandurildocs.png" title="A menu of surveillance towers with prices." width="970" /></p> <p><span>If you click "Matches Found in Price List" you'll download a spreadsheet that serves as a blueprint of what the company offers, including contract personnel. Here's a snippet from Palantir's: </span><br /><span></span></p> <p><span><img alt="A spreadsheet with prices for various Palantir services." height="276" src="https://www.eff.org/files/2026/01/05/gsamatchespricelist.png" title="A spreadsheet with prices for various Palantir services." width="966" /></span></p> <h2><span>4.
