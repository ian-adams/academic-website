abstract: "This study focuses on police profanity, with a particular interest developing\
  \ reasonable policy to regulate the use of the word \"fuck.\" Officers employ \"\
  fuck\" as a linguistic tool to accomplish a range of goals, such as establishing\
  \ authority, fostering solidarity, and diffusing tension. However, â\x80\x9Cfuckâ\x80\
  \x9D can also be used derogatorily, and negatively impact public assessments of\
  \ police actions. Policy in this area is either absent, overly broad, or inappropriate\
  \ to its intended use. Following brief, unstructured interviews with line and executive\
  \ officers, I propose a novel policy theory of profanity, deriving target and intent.\
  \ I test the theory in a pre-registered experiment administered to a sample of police\
  \ and human resources executives (n=1,492), with each respondent evaluating multiple\
  \ vignettes (n=5,280 observations). Results support the proposed theory and generate\
  \ useful recommendations for practitioners interested in strengthening the ability\
  \ of agencies to constrain professionally inappropriate use of profanity in the\
  \ police workplace."
summary: This study examines how police officers use profanity, particularly the word
  "fuck," finding that officers use it for various purposes including asserting authority
  and building camaraderie with colleagues, but also sometimes in ways that harm public
  perception of police. Through interviews and experiments with nearly 1,500 police
  and HR executives, the research develops a framework for creating better policies
  that distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate uses of profanity based on
  who it's directed at and why it's being used. This matters because most police departments
  currently lack clear, practical guidelines for officer language, leaving agencies
  unable to effectively address unprofessional conduct while still allowing officers
  to communicate effectively in high-stress situations.
