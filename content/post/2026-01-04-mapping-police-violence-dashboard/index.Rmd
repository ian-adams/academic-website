I've developed an interactive dashboard to explore data from [Mapping Police Violence](https://mappingpoliceviolence.us), a comprehensive database tracking police killings in the United States. The dashboard automatically pulls the latest data and provides multiple analytical views to examine temporal trends, demographic patterns, and geographic distributions. This is a **vibe-coded prototype**: a rapid, exploratory build to see how far one can get in standing up a public-data dashboard with automated ingestion and standard visual analytics.


**Critical disclaimer:** I have not independently verified the MPV data, nor have I formally audited or validated my cleaning and harmonization routines. Treat everything here as exploratory and illustrative. The outputs are not suitable for professional, policy, legal, journalistic, or operational use, and should not be relied upon as an authoritative accounting of levels, rates, rankings, or trends.

## Dashboard Features

The **MPV Analytical Engine** includes several key analytical modules:

### Overview Panel
- Real-time statistics including total incidents, per capita rates, and demographic breakdowns
- Cumulative trajectory visualization comparing year-over-year trends
- Temporal heatmaps showing patterns by day and month
- Day-of-week analysis

### Demographics
- Racial and ethnic distribution of victims
- Age distribution and age-by-race breakdowns
- Analysis of unarmed victims by demographic group

### Behavioral Context
- Armed/unarmed status of victims
- Types of alleged weapons
- Fleeing status at time of incident
- Mental health-related encounters over time
- Body camera adoption trends

### Geographic Analysis
- National map of incidents
- State and city-level breakdowns
- Top jurisdictions by incident count

### Accountability
- Criminal charges filed against officers over time
- Neighborhood income disparities

**Note:** The dashboard may take a moment to load as it downloads and processes the latest data from Mapping Police Violence.

## Important Methodological Notes

This dashboard presents **descriptive statistics only**. The data shows observed patterns but cannot establish causal relationships without additional controls for:

- Local crime rates
- Police deployment density
- Population demographics
- Socioeconomic factors
- Jurisdictional policies

The dashboard uses US Census population projections (2013-2025) to calculate per capita rates. All racial categorizations follow the source data from Mapping Police Violence.

## Data Source

Data is automatically synchronized from [Mapping Police Violence](https://mappingpoliceviolence.us).

## Technical Details

The dashboard is built using:
- **R Shiny** with the `bslib` framework for modern UI components
- **tidyverse** for data manipulation
- **plotly** for interactive visualizations
- **sf** and **rnaturalearth** for geographic mapping

The app automatically downloads fresh data daily and includes robust data cleaning pipelines to standardize variables across time periods.

## Code Availability

The complete source code for this dashboard is available in the [academic-website repository](https://github.com/ian-adams/academic-website/tree/master/shiny-apps/mpv-dashboard).
