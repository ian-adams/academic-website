Something to remember - most data scientists spend most of their time cleaning, transforming, and tidying their data. That’s what these chapters and questions are all about. So I want to make sure you have the correct answers, but more importantly, I want you to know you are not alone, this stuff is hard! I’ve put the quote in front of you before, but this little bit of wisdom from Hadley Wickham, lead author of our class textbook, is important during times like we’re having right now:\n\r“There is no way of going from knowing nothing about a subject to knowing something about a subject without going through a period of much frustration and suckiness. Push through. You’ll suck less.”\n\rNow, onto the answers!\nExercise 5.2.4\r\rWhy is NA ^ 0 not missing? Why is NA | TRUE not missing?\rWhy is FALSE \u0026amp; NA not missing? Can you figure out the general rule?\r(NA * 0 is a tricky counterexample!)\n\r\rNA ^ 0\r## [1] 1\rNA ^ 0 == 1 since for all numeric values \\(x ^ 0 = 1\\).\nNA | TRUE\r## [1] TRUE\rNA | TRUE is TRUE because anything or TRUE is TRUE.\rIf the missing value were TRUE, then TRUE | TRUE == TRUE,\rand if the missing value was FALSE, then FALSE | TRUE == TRUE.\nNA \u0026amp; FALSE\r## [1] FALSE\rThe value of NA \u0026amp; FALSE is FALSE because anything and FALSE is always FALSE.\rIf the missing value were TRUE, then TRUE \u0026amp; FALSE == FALSE,\rand if the missing value was FALSE, then FALSE \u0026amp; FALSE == FALSE.\nNA | FALSE\r## [1] NA\rFor NA | FALSE, the value is unknown since TRUE | FALSE == TRUE, but FALSE | FALSE == FALSE.\nNA \u0026amp; TRUE\r## [1] NA\rFor NA \u0026amp; TRUE, the value is unknown since FALSE \u0026amp; TRUE== FALSE, but TRUE \u0026amp; TRUE == TRUE.\nNA * 0\r## [1] NA\rSince \\(x * 0 = 0\\) for all finite numbers we might expect NA * 0 == 0, but that’s not the case.\rThe reason that NA * 0 != 0 is that \\(0 \\times \\infty\\) and \\(0 \\times -\\infty\\) are undefined.\rR represents undefined results as NaN, which is an abbreviation of “not a number”.\nInf * 0\r## [1] NaN\r-Inf * 0\r## [1] NaN\r\r\rExercise 5.3.1\r\rHow could you use arrange() to sort all missing values to the start?

arr_time - dep_time.\rWhat do you expect to see?\rWhat do you see?\rWhat do you need to do to fix it?\n\r\rI expect that air_time is the difference between the arrival (arr_time) and departure times (dep_time).\rIn other words, air_time = arr_time - dep_time.\nTo check that this relationship, I’ll first need to convert the times to a form more amenable to arithmetic operations using the same calculations as the previous exercise.\nflights_airtime \u0026lt;-\rmutate(flights,\rdep_time = (dep_time %/% 100 * 60 + dep_time %% 100) %% 1440,\rarr_time = (arr_time %/% 100 * 60 + arr_time %% 100) %% 1440,\rair_time_diff = air_time - arr_time + dep_time\r)\rSo, does air_time = arr_time - dep_time?\rIf so, there should be no flights with non-zero values of air_time_diff.\nnrow(filter(flights_airtime, air_time_diff != 0))\r## [1] 327150\rIt turns out that there are many flights for which air_time != arr_time - dep_time.\rOther than data errors, I can think of two reasons why air_time would not equal arr_time - dep_time.\nThe flight passes midnight, so arr_time \u0026lt; dep_time.\rIn these cases, the difference in airtime should be by 24 hours (1,440 minutes).\n\rThe flight crosses time zones, and the total air time will be off by hours (multiples of 60).\rAll flights in flights departed from New York City and are domestic flights in the US.\rThis means that flights will all be to the same or more westerly time zones.\rGiven the time-zones in the US, the differences due to time-zone should be 60 minutes (Central)\r120 minutes (Mountain), 180 minutes (Pacific), 240 minutes (Alaska), or 300 minutes (Hawaii).\n\r\rBoth of these explanations have clear patterns that I would expect to see if they\rwere true.\rIn particular, in both cases, since time-zones and crossing midnight only affects the hour part of the time, all values of air_time_diff should be divisible by 60.\rI’ll visually check this hypothesis by plotting the distribution of air_time_diff.\rIf those two explanations are correct, distribution of air_time_diff should comprise only spikes at multiples of 60.\nggplot(flights_airtime, aes(x = air_time_diff)) +\rgeom_histogram(binwidth = 1)\r## Warning: Removed 9430 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin).\rThis is not the case.\rWhile, the distribution of air_time_diff has modes at multiples of 60 as hypothesized,\rit shows that there are many flights in which the difference between air time and local arrival and departure times is not divisible by 60.\nLet’s also look at flights with Los Angeles as a destination.\rThe discrepancy should be 180 minutes.\nggplot(filter(flights_airtime, dest == \u0026quot;LAX\u0026quot;), aes(x = air_time_diff)) +\rgeom_histogram(binwidth = 1)\r## Warning: Removed 148 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin).\rTo fix these time-zone issues, I would want to convert all the times to a date-time to handle overnight flights, and from local time to a common time zone, most likely UTC, to handle flights crossing time-zones.\rThe tzone column of nycflights13::airports gives the time-zone of each airport.\rSee the “Dates and Times” for an introduction on working with date and time data.\nBut that still leaves the other differences unexplained.\rSo what else might be going on?\rThere seem to be too many problems for this to be data entry problems, so I’m probably missing something.\rSo, I’ll reread the documentation to make sure that I understand the definitions of arr_time, dep_time, and\rair_time.\rThe documentation contains a link to the source of the flights data, https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236.\rThis documentation shows that the flights data does not contain the variables TaxiIn, TaxiOff, WheelsIn, and WheelsOff.\rIt appears that the air_time variable refers to flight time, which is defined as the time between wheels-off (take-off) and wheels-in (landing).\rBut the flight time does not include time spent on the runway taxiing to and from gates.\rWith this new understanding of the data, I now know that the relationship between air_time, arr_time, and dep_time is air_time \u0026lt;= arr_time - dep_time, supposing that the time zones of arr_time and dep_time are in the same time zone.\n\r\rExercise 5.6.7\r\rBrainstorm at least 5 different ways to assess the typical delay characteristics of a group of flights.\rConsider the following scenarios:\n\rA flight is 15 minutes early 50% of the time, and 15 minutes late 50% of the time.\rA flight is always 10 minutes late.\rA flight is 30 minutes early 50% of the time, and 30 minutes late 50% of the time.\r99% of the time a flight is on time. 1% of the time it’s 2 hours late.\r\rWhich is more important: arrival delay or departure delay?\n\r\rWhat this question gets at is a fundamental question of data analysis: the cost function.\rAs analysts, the reason we are interested in flight delay because it is costly to passengers.\rBut it is worth thinking carefully about how it is costly and use that information in ranking and measuring these scenarios.\nIn many scenarios, arrival delay is more important.\rIn most cases, being arriving late is more costly to the passenger since it could disrupt the next stages of their travel, such as connecting flights or scheduled meetings.\nIf a departure is delayed without affecting the arrival time, this delay will not have those affects plans nor does it affect the total time spent traveling.\rThis delay could be beneficial, if less time is spent in the cramped confines of the airplane itself, or a negative, if that delayed time is still spent in the cramped confines of the airplane on the runway.\nVariation in arrival time is worse than consistency.\rIf a flight is always 30 minutes late and that delay is known, then it is as if the arrival time is that delayed time.\rThe traveler could easily plan for this.\rBut higher variation in flight times makes it harder to plan.\n5.6.7.2\r\rCome up with another approach that will give you the same output as not_cancelled %\u0026gt;% count(dest) and not_cancelled %\u0026gt;% count(tailnum, wt = distance)

the total number of flights in a day.\rThere should be an increasing relationship for two reasons.\rFirst, if all flights are equally likely to be cancelled, then days with more flights should have a higher number of cancellations.\rSecond, it is likely that days with more flights would have a higher probability of cancellations because congestion itself can cause delays and any delay would affect

The tools of statistics are a complement, not a\rsubstitute, for that knowledge.\nWith that in mind, Let’s plot the distribution of the ground speed of flights.\rThe modal flight in this data has a ground speed of between 400 and 500 mph.\rThe distribution of ground speeds has a large left tail of slower flights below\r400 mph constituting the majority.\rThere are very few flights with a ground speed over 500 mph.\nflights %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(mph = distance / (air_time / 60)) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(x = mph)) +\rgeom_histogram(binwidth = 10)\r## Warning: Removed 9430 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin).\rThe fastest flight is the same one identified as the largest outlier earlier.\rIts ground speed was 703 mph.\rThis is fast for a commercial jet, but not impossible.\nflights %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(mph = distance / (air_time / 60)) %\u0026gt;%\rarrange(desc(mph)) %\u0026gt;%\rselect(mph, flight, carrier, flight, month, day, dep_time) %\u0026gt;%\rhead(5)\r## # A tibble: 5 x 6\r## mph flight carrier month day dep_time\r## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt;\r## 1 703. 1499 DL 5 25 1709\r## 2 650. 4667 EV 7 2 1558\r## 3 648 4292 EV 5 13 2040\r## 4 641. 3805 EV 3 23 1914\r## 5 591. 1902 DL 1 12 1559\rOne explanation for unusually fast flights is that they are “making up time” in the air by flying faster.\rCommercial aircraft do not fly at their top speed since the airlines are also concerned about fuel consumption.\rBut, if a flight is delayed on the ground, it may fly faster than usual in order to avoid a late arrival.\rSo, I would expect that some of the unusually fast flights were delayed on departure.\nflights %\u0026gt;%\rmutate(mph = distance / (air_time / 60)) %\u0026gt;%\rarrange(desc(mph)) %\u0026gt;%\rselect(\rorigin, dest, mph, year, month, day, dep_time, flight, carrier,\rdep_delay, arr_delay\r)\r## # A tibble: 336,776 x 11\r## origin dest mph year month day dep_time flight carrier dep_delay\r## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\r## 1 LGA ATL 703. 2013 5 25 1709 1499 DL 9\r## 2 EWR MSP 650. 2013 7 2 1558 4667 EV 45\r## 3 EWR GSP 648 2013 5 13 2040 4292 EV 15\r## 4 EWR BNA 641. 2013 3 23 1914 3805 EV 4\r## 5 LGA PBI 591. 2013 1 12 1559 1902 DL -1\r## 6 JFK SJU 564 2013 11 17 650 315 DL -5\r## 7 JFK SJU 557. 2013 2 21 2355 707 B6 -3\r## 8 JFK STT 556. 2013 11 17 759 936 AA -1\r## 9 JFK SJU 554. 2013 11 16 2003 347 DL 38\r## 10 JFK SJU 554. 2013 11 16 2349 1503 B6 -10\r## # ... with 336,766 more rows, and 1 more variable: arr_delay \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;\rhead(5)\r## [1] 5\rFive of the top ten flights had departure delays, and three of those were\rable to make up that time in the air and arrive ahead of schedule.\nOverall, there were a few flights that seemed unusually fast, but they all\rfall into the realm of plausibility and likely are not data entry problems.\r[Ed.

The pandemic has infected over one hundred million individuals and killed over two million worldwide. Police officers are not immune to these adverse outcomes, with 221 law enforcement deaths in the U.S. attributed to the virus in 2020 alone. The death toll from COVID-19 accounts for 65% of all U.S. law enforcement deaths in 2020 and is five times the number of officer deaths from gunfire (ODMP, 2021). As of October 2020, nearly 6,000 members of the New York City Police Department had tested positive for COVID-19, and 46 members had died (Eyewitness News, 2020). As of January 2021, over 500 members of the Detroit Police Department had tested positive for COVID-19, including the Chief of Police. The department reports losing approximately 20,000 working days during the pandemic due to officer quarantines (Abdel-Baqui, 2021).\nThe stark realities of the pandemic’s effect on law enforcement have necessitated operational changes for police agencies. These challenges and changes are exacerbated because of the heightened risk of exposure for police officers due to their frequent close contact with members of the public (Jennings \u0026amp; Perez, 2020). With no blueprint on managing operations in a pandemic, police agencies have had to make frequent changes in uncertain circumstances (Jones, 2020). Some of these changes have included suspending training and roll calls, limiting access to department facilities, suspending community outreach initiatives, and transitioning employees to telecommuting when possible (Jennings \u0026amp; Perez, 2020). Further, many agencies report limiting proactive traffic and pedestrian stops and responding remotely (i.e., telephone, internet, videoconference) to some calls-for-service (Lum et al., 2020a, 2020b).\nLaw enforcement agencies have had to adopt a medical approach, acquiring and (hopefully) implementing epidemiologists’ advice on slowing the virus’s spread within their agencies (Jones, 2020). This advice has included the expanded use of personal protective equipment (PPE), such as N95 masks, gloves, disinfectant use, and rigorous decontamination procedures upon exposure (Centers for Disease Control, 2020; Simpson \u0026amp; Sandrin, 2021). Even with these precautions, police agencies have experienced severe staffing shortages due to illness and prophylactic quarantines (Abdel-Baqui, 2021; Eyewitness News, 2020; Stone, 2021). It has been suggested that these pandemic-related staffing shortages may be linked to fewer homicides being solved (Calvert \u0026amp; Elinson, 2020), increased violent crime (Abdel-Baqui, 2021; Rosenfeld \u0026amp; Lopez, 2020), and mental and operational fatigue (Jiang, 2020). Compounding these struggles are increases in domestic violence cases, themselves associated with pandemic-related stay-at-home orders (Leslie \u0026amp; Wilson, 2020; Nix \u0026amp; Richards, 2021).\nA diminished workforce has been identified as a primary obstacle to policing during a pandemic. Absenteeism places additional stress on the remaining available officers, impacts performance, and adds further stress on remaining officers (Laufs \u0026amp; Waseem, 2020). With the impossibility of removing all risks for infection and continued demand for public engagement (Nix et al., 2021), the only apparent long-term solution is widespread vaccinations within police agencies. However, with the combination of the newness of the COVID-19 vaccines, the rapid manner in which they were developed and distributed, the reluctance of most agencies to mandate vaccination (PERF, 2021a), and many agencies facing the specter of low vaccination rates within their organizations (PERF, 2021a; Rector, 2021), it is still unclear how much of an effect the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines will have on law enforcement workforces.\nWith the reported efficacy rates of the first two vaccines being distributed—approximately 95% (Branswell, 2021)—the expectation is substantial decreases in infection rate within a department upon widespread vaccination. However, as police officers are at a particularly heightened risk of exposure (Jennings \u0026amp; Perez, 2020) and perhaps more reluctant to undergo vaccination voluntarily (Rector, 2021), ultimately, this remains an empirical question. We examine vaccines’ effect on a police population in one large police department in the western U.S., providing an early investigation into the causal link between agency-level vaccinations and infection rates.\n\rData and Methods\rWe obtained daily infection case data from the Salt Lake City Police Department (SLCPD). The data was collected beginning March 9, 2020, and continued through February 12, 2021, for a total of 341 time-series data points. The SLCPD is authorized 691 employees. Over the studied time period, the total number of employees fluctuated between 600 and 691 due to resignations, retirements, and hiring of new personnel. Throughout the studied period, the agency had 85 positive tests, equating to 12% of its authorized workforce.\nThe state of Utah began the first phase of its vaccination program in early December 2020. The initial phase provided for the vaccination of hospital healthcare workers, long-term care facility residents and staff, non-hospital healthcare workers, and public health and tribal health care workers. The second part of Utah’s initial vaccination phase included law enforcement officers and K-12 teachers. Utah primarily used local health departments for vaccination administration. The SLCPD is situated in Salt Lake County. The county’s health department began providing vaccinations to law enforcement staff on January 6, 2021. Given the impact and importance of civilian staff on law enforcement agency operations (Adams \u0026amp; Mastracci, 2020), both sworn and non-sworn staff were included in the vaccination program. Slightly more than 70% of all SLCPD police department employees received a first vaccination over four days.1\nTo analyze the vaccination program’s effect on SLCPD’s infection rate, we estimate a Bayesian Structural Time Series (BSTS) model2. We leverage the model to conduct a causal impact analysis (Brodersen et al., 2015). When a series of measures are broken up by introducing an intervention that occurs at a specific point in time, time-series analysis is appropriate (Shadish et al., 2002). Both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines were used during the police officer vaccinations (Baden et al., 2021; Polack et al., 2020). Both vaccines require two doses. The interval between Moderna doses is 28 days, and 21 days for the Pfizer vaccine (Branswell, 2021). Even with employees receiving the required second doses in the following weeks, it is reported that the Pfizer vaccine is approximately 52% effective after the first dose, and the Moderna vaccine is approximately 80% effective after the first dose (Gorvett, 2021). However, more recent evidence indicates that just an initial vaccine dose alone is approximately 92% effective for both vaccines (Skowronski \u0026amp; De Serres, 2021). Accordingly, the intervention date in the analysis is January 6, 2021 (i.e., the first day of vaccinations), resulting in 303 pre-intervention data points and 38 post-intervention data points.\nA cursory review of the data appears to indicate that vaccinations did affect the agency’s infection rate. As observed in Figure 1, a rapid decline in the seven-day rolling average infection rate per 100 employees occurred immediately following the vaccine intervention point. Within weeks, the seven-day average fell to zero, eliminating the impact of infections among agency personnel.\nFigure 1. 7-Day Rolling Average of Infection Rate per 100 Employees November 1st, 2020 – February 12th, 2021.\n\rHowever, this uncontrolled analysis cannot judge whether the observed change is significantly different from what we would have expected if vaccinations had not occurred. Infection rates have ebbed and flowed during the pandemic during various ‘surges.’ As an overall decrease in positive cases was experienced within the state while the agency rate plummeted, it may be the observed reduction was not causally related to the vaccination program at SLCPD. For a more robust assessment of the impact of vaccinations on the agency infection rate, we turn to the BSTS model.\n\rCausal Inference\rBSTS models are used to infer causal impact by predicting the counterfactual treatment response in a synthetic control that would have occurred if no intervention had taken place. The synthetic control is constructed using the experimental group’s time-series behavior before and after the intervention and combining control variables predictive of the target series before the intervention (Mourtgos et al., 2021). A key component of utilizing BSTS models for causal impact analysis is the identification of predictors. Predictors are regressed onto the observed values, creating the composite synthetic control series.\nA police department is a microcosm of its surrounding communities. Accordingly, its COVID-19 infection rate should generally follow similar patterns as the city, county, and state where it is situated. To assess this logic’s soundness, Figure 2 plots the seven-day rolling average infection rate per 100 persons for SLCPD, Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County, and the state of Utah from March 9, 2020, through January 5, 2021 (i.e., the pre-intervention period). As shown, the infection rate closely tracks the infection rate of these different community levels, though a noticeably higher rate of infection among SLCPD employees compared to the underlying community is detectable beginning in late summer 2020. Importantly, if vaccination of almost three-quarters of the police department had a significant effect on its infection rate, we would not expect to see a similar drop in these other three measures, as the vast majority of individuals in these larger communities were not being vaccinated during the same period. As such, the concurrent city, county, and state infection rates are employed as control variables in the synthetic model.\nFigure 2. 7-Day Rolling Average of Infection Rate per 100 Persons March 9th, 2020 – Jan 5th, 2021.\n\rA BSTS model was estimated for the department’s infection rate. The model makes probabilistic estimations of what the department’s infection rate ‘should’ have been without the vaccination intervention. These probabilistic estimations are based on the department’s infection rate prior to vaccinations and its statistical relationship with the surrounding communities’ infection rates3. This allows us to compare the department’s infection rate following the vaccination intervention with what we would have expected it to be without the vaccination intervention. Results for the model assessing change in the infection rate are presented in Figure 3.\nFigure 3. Significant Decrease in Positive Cases Following Vaccinations.\n\rTable 1 demonstrates the vaccinations are associated with decreased COVID-19 infection rates at the studied police department. During the post-vaccination period, the average infection rate per 100 was 0.043. By contrast, in the absence of vaccinations, a counterfactual average infection rate of 0.127 per 100 would be expected. Subtracting this prediction from the observed response yields an estimate of the vaccinations’ absolute causal effect on the COVID-19 infection rate per 100 employees (-0.084), resulting in a 66% relative decrease in the infection rate. The posterior probability of the observed effect is .95. In other words, there is a very high probability that the vaccinations reduced the COVID-19 infection rate at the studied police department.\nNote that in Figure 3, the synthetic model also predicts a declining infection rate. This predicted trend demonstrates the estimated model’s credibility, as a natural decrease in SLCPD’s surrounding communities was observed around the same period. However, the police department’s vaccinations depressed the infection rate (to zero) much quicker than would have otherwise been expected in the counterfactual scenario.\nTable 1. Causal Impact Posterior Inference.\n\r\rDiscussion\rThe COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant obstacles to policing. One of the most challenging pandemic outcomes has been keeping police department workforce levels operationally viable (Abdel-Baqui, 2021). The above analysis shows that vaccinating a large percentage of a police agency can help protect its employees and allow for adequate operational staffing. A vaccination program at the studied agency is associated with a rapid decrease of infections among employees, effectively eliminating the pandemic’s effect on staffing.\nRapidly documenting and communicating these findings are especially important during a period where a policing ‘workforce crisis’ has already been identified (PERF, 2019). While this may seem to be a fairly obvious solution to the problems the pandemic is causing law enforcement agencies, we hope that empirically documenting this result within a police agency will 1) help encourage officers in other agencies to get vaccinated, and 2) support agencies in making intensive efforts to boost staff vaccination rates.\nBefore encouraging officers to take advantage of the vaccine, however, agencies must have access to it. Reporting indicates that access has proven more difficult in some areas than what the studied agency experienced. Delayed access to vaccines for police officers has been reported in many areas, including Ohio (Halperin, 2021), California (Cain, 2021; Gotfredson, 2021), and New York (NBC New York, 2021). Logistical delays may not be the only hindrance to a well-vaccinated law enforcement workforce. Internal surveys at several agencies have reported that their workforce intends to receive the vaccine at a much lower rate than that observed at SLCPD. These estimates range from 33% to 60% (PERF, 2021a; Rector, 2021). Low vaccination rates could prove problematic as it is estimated that at least 70% of a population needs to be immune to create herd immunity (Mayo Clinic, 2021).\nMost police agencies are not mandating vaccination (PERF, 2021a). Though likely legal and effective, mandatory vaccinations are controversial and raise a host of ethical concerns (Dubov \u0026amp; Phung, 2015). Even when forced vaccination is legal, it is suggested that mandated compliance increases resistance within a workforce (Laufs \u0026amp; Waseem, 2020). Instead, education and modeling are advocated. The Los Angeles Fire Department recognized hesitancy within their organization regarding the vaccine. To encourage firefighters to take advantage of the vaccine, the Chief regularly disseminated charts and data regarding the pandemic’s effect on the organization and its staff. Further, the Chief publicly received the vaccine when it was available, along with the organization’s two union presidents. As a result, similar to the studied police department, the Los Angeles Fire Department also achieved approximately 70% of its employees being vaccinated (PERF, 2021b).\nInterestingly, the studied police department mirrored the Los Angeles Fire Department in its vaccination strategy. A captain was appointed in mid-2020 to oversee SLCPD’s internal COVID-19 response. The captain sent weekly updates with information and charts explaining the pandemic’s effect on its workforce. As the vaccination plan was contemplated, the vaccine’s efficacy and safety were regularly communicated to staff in both written and in-person formats. The statewide law enforcement labor organization communicated early support for the program, taking a positive stance towards vaccination in mid-December 2020. Further, the Chief of Police made his vaccination experience public.\nWhile outside the scope of this study to recommend a specific course of action for agencies to follow in their vaccination programs, we view the reported results as providing two mainline takeaways. First, COVID-19 vaccines work. Second, access to, and widespread uptake of, COVID-19 vaccines is necessary. Agency and labor organization leadership can play an essential role in driving the voluntary vaccination rate towards levels that support herd immunity. As this study demonstrates, high vaccination rates can allow an agency to recover swiftly, with new COVID-19 infection rates among staff at or near zero. Recent evidence indicates that just one dose of the vaccines are ~92% effective (Skowronski \u0026amp; De Serres, 2021). The findings presented here make it clear that there are significant positive effects for both the agency and its workforce from widespread vaccination. As the vaccine becomes more widely available, non-first responder public agencies should begin early efforts similar to those reported here to best prepare their staff.\nFuture research should attempt to replicate our findings while considering what factors contribute to varying voluntary vaccination rates within law enforcement and other first responder populations. There are continuing, but thus far unresolved, questions regarding whether COVID-19 will become endemic (Hernandez \u0026amp; Hinshaw, 2021), while variants in the disease also raise the possibility that current vaccination regimes will prove insufficient (Centers for Disease Control, 2021). To that point, at this time we cannot know the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines over longer periods. By documenting the results of vaccination programs in the many varied contexts of US law enforcement today, scholars can contribute towards a knowledge base addressing ongoing and future epidemiological threats.\n\rReferences\rAbdel-Baqui, O.

At the completion of these make-up sessions, approximately 75% of the Salt Lake City Police Department’s workforce was vaccinated.

First, BSTS models are flexible and modular. This allows for researchers to determine the structure of the model by considering whether and how to include regressors, whether short- or long-term predictions are more important, and whether seasonal model components are necessary (Scott, 2017). Further, by working in a Bayesian framework, investigators can better acknowledge and incorporate uncertainty into statistical models and discuss outcomes in terms of probabilities, which tend to be more intuitive.↩︎\n\rThe BSTS model was estimated with a local linear trend state component and a regression component for the control variables with spike-and-slab priors over coefficients. Ten thousand Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples were drawn, with 89% posterior distribution credible intervals generated.↩︎\n\r\r\r","date":1614294431,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614294431,"objectID":"4e34270b9ab37734b21822bcac664756","permalink":"https://ianadamsresearch.com/publication/covid-19-vaccine-infection-rate-police/","publishdate":"2021-02-25T16:07:11-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/covid-19-vaccine-infection-rate-police/","section":"publication","summary":"COVID-19 has created tremendous operational difficulties for law enforcement agencies, with substantial portions of their staff quarantined for either exposure or infection.

One of the main uses for synthetic control models is for inference. In other words, can we infer causality for the somewhat dramatic change between the pre- and post-intervention periods? The package developer has included some very nice features to help with inference. From the package developer:\n\rFor inference, the method relies on repeating the method for every donor in the donor pool exactly as was done for the treated unit — i.e. generating placebo synthetic controls. By setting generate_placebos = TRUE when initializing the synth pipeline with synthetic_control(), placebo cases are automatically generated when constructing the synthetic control of interest. This makes it easy to explore how unique difference between the observed and synthetic unit is when compared to the placebos.\n\rsmoking_out %\u0026gt;% plot_placebos()\rYou might wonder why the plot above is only plotting a few of the donor cases. This is because the plain function of plot_placebos() automatically drops those cases where the data has a poor fit to the model. This is a fairly large difference between this package, which uses a frequentist approach, and BSTS, which obviously uses a Bayesian approach. Still, the package developer has a prune = FALSE argument you can use to see all the cases, regardless of data –\u0026gt; model fit.\n\rNote that the plot_placebos() function automatically prunes any placebos that poorly fit the data in the pre-intervention period. The reason for doing so is purely visual: those units tend to throw off the scale when plotting the placebos. To prune, the function looks at the pre-intervention period mean squared prediction error (MSPE) (i.e. a metric that reflects how well the synthetic control maps to the observed outcome time series in pre-intervention period). If a placebo control has a MSPE that is two times beyond the target case (e.g. “California”), then it’s dropped. To turn off this behavior, set prune = FALSE.\n\rsmoking_out %\u0026gt;% plot_placebos(prune = FALSE)\rSome researchers prefer a frequentist approach, and one of the advantages of this approach is that we can derive Fisher’s Exact P-values based on work from Abadie et al., (2010). Interpretation is straightforward:\n\rIf the intervention had no effect, then the post-period and pre-period should continue to map onto one another fairly well, yielding a ratio close to 1. If the placebo units fit the data similarly, then we can’t reject the hull hypothesis that there is no effect brought about by the intervention.\n\r\rThis ratio can be easily plotted using plot_mspe_ratio(), offering insight into the rarity of the case where the intervention actually occurred.\n\rsmoking_out %\u0026gt;% plot_mspe_ratio()\rFor those who want to publish their results, reviewers and readers are going to want a table of results.

Adams, University of Utah Justin Nix, University of Nebraska Omaha Tara Richards, University of Nebraska Omaha  Introduction Untested sexual assault kits (SAKs) represent a critical public policy gap in addressing sexual assault, with estimates suggesting that as many as 400,000 SAKs remain untested in police storage across the country (Office of the Press Secretary, 2015). Indeed, despite the evidentiary usefulness of SAKs (Valentine et al., 2019), large numbers of SAKs are ‘shelved’ and never submitted to crime laboratories for analysis (Campbell et al., 2015; Hendrix et al., 2019; Lovell et al., 2018; Lovrich et al., 2004; Wells, 2016). The fact that many SAKs remain untested has resulted in pointed critiques of police investigatory practices in sexual assault cases (Campbell et al., 2019; Campbell \u0026amp; Fehler-Cabral, 2019; Goodman-Williams \u0026amp; Campbell, 2019; Valentine et al., 2019) and has served as a catalyst for mandatory SAK testing policies at both the state and municipal levels over the past decade (Davis et al., 2020). Prior research has suggested many potential reasons to implement mandatory SAK testing policies. These include: identification of serial rapists, increased reporting of sexual assaults, populating the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) with offender profiles, and removing bias from the decision-making process for whether to submit a particular SAK (Campbell et al., 2019; Davis et al., 2020; Goodman-Williams \u0026amp; Campbell, 2019; Hendrix et al., 2019; Lovell et al., 2019; Valentine et al., 2019). An additional proposed benefit to mandating SAK testing, which we focus on in this study, is higher rates of arrest for sexual assault (Davis et al., 2020). An increased arrest rate for sexual assault—as a means of holding more offenders accountable and restoring justice to more victims—is a shared goal among police, advocates, researchers, and policymakers. Sexual assault continues to be the most under-reported violent crime in the US (Langton et al., 2012; Lonsway \u0026amp; Archambault, 2012), and criminal justice system attrition among cases that are reported is high (Richards et al., 2019). For example, according to the FBI, in 2018, just 18 percent of rapes reported to law enforcement resulted in an arrest (FBI, 2019), and at least one study suggests that only between 3 and 26 percent of reported sexual assault cases result in a conviction (Lonsway \u0026amp; Archambault, 2012).\nWhile there is a need for scientific evidence in the formulation of crime policy (Gies et al., 2020), surprisingly little attention has been directed at whether mandatory SAK testing policies do in fact increase arrest rates for sexual assault (Hendrix et al., 2019; Strom \u0026amp; Hickman, 2016). If a primary goal of an improved criminal justice response to sexual assault is to provide justice to more victims and hold more offenders accountable, an increase in the sexual assault arrest rate is necessary. Arrests are an important marker of sexual assault investigations (Alderden \u0026amp; Ullman, 2012; Ylang \u0026amp; Holtfreter, 2019) and a required prerequisite to an improved criminal justice response to sexual assault investigations. If mandatory SAK testing policies do not provide a demonstrable improvement in the rate of arrest for sexual assaults, it could result in lost legitimacy for the police, which might in turn decrease victims' propensity to come forward (Murphy \u0026amp; Barkworth, 2014; Sunshine \u0026amp; Tyler, 2003; Tankebe, 2013). Accordingly, research assessing the efficacy of mandatory SAK testing policies is sorely needed.\nIn the current study, we examine the effects of a mandatory SAK testing policy on sexual assault arrests in a large jurisdiction in the western US. We accomplish this by utilizing a novel technique known as Bayesian structural time-series modeling, a type of time-series quasi-experimental method (Brodersen et al., 2015b). Our findings show no effect on the arrest rate for sexual assault and raise significant concerns about the efficacy of mandatory SAK testing policies to increase arrests. Further, they highlight the need to ensure appropriate resources are provided to investigating agencies and crime laboratories when such policies are considered (Wells, 2016), as well as to consider other causes of low sexual assault arrest rates.\nSexual Assault Kits (SAKs) The collection of medical forensic evidence in sexual assault investigations became common practice in the 1980s (Goodman-Williams \u0026amp; Campbell, 2019). It is now routine for law enforcement to encourage sexual assault victims to undergo a forensic interview including a SAK upon reporting an incident. Typically performed by sexual assault nurse examiners (SANEs), SAK examinations include collecting biological evidence, such as semen and saliva, which may be present on victims' bodies post-sexual assault. After collection, SANEs supply the SAK to law enforcement for use in the investigatory process (Valentine et al., 2019). With the availability of the CODIS database, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) profiles collected during SAK examinations can be compared against DNA profiles of arrestees, convicted offenders, and other SAK evidence and crime scenes from across the United States (Butler, 2005; Jobling \u0026amp; Gill, 2004; Wells et al., 2019).\nThe ability to identify and evaluate DNA profiles obtained during sexual assault investigations holds significant investigatory power. For example, unknown perpetrators can be identified if their DNA profile is already housed in CODIS. Investigators may also identify serial offenders by linking a specific DNA profile to multiple sexual assault cases and victims (Goodman-Williams \u0026amp; Campbell, 2019; Lovell et al., 2019). The benefits are not just realized in CODIS utilization, however. While a substantial proportion of sexual assault cases hinge on issues of consent, simply being able to confirm that biological evidence collected during a SAK examination belongs to a specific suspect who denies any sexual contact with the victim can be potent evidence of guilt.\nYet, even with these clear evidentiary benefits, there have been multiple reports over the last decade, from all across the United States, describing how large quantities of SAKs have been left untested in police evidence warehouses (Valentine et al., 2019). For example, in 2002, it was reported that approximately 13,000 SAKs collected in Los Angeles County were never submitted for testing. In 2009, more than 11,000 unsubmitted SAKs were located in a Detroit Police Department evidence warehouse (Hendrix et al., 2019). Similarly, thousands of untested SAKs were found in Cuyahoga County, Ohio (Campbell \u0026amp; Fehler-Cabral, 2019). Of course, the exact number is unknown, as many jurisdictions report being unaware of precisely how many untested SAKs they possess (Keteyian, 2009).\nConsidering the advantages above, why might so many SAKs go untested? Until the recent exposure of large numbers of untested SAKs, the decision to submit SAKs to a crime laboratory for DNA processing was left to individual police investigators' discretion. Paralleling how they pursue investigations for other crimes (Brandl \u0026amp; Frank, 1994; Eck, 1983, 1992; Lum et al., 2018; Scott et al., 2019; Wellford \u0026amp; Cronin, 1999), there are several reasons why investigators might choose not to submit a SAK for testing. First, a non-trivial number of victims do not proceed with investigations once the initial allegation is made (Campbell et al., 2015; Richards et al., 2019; Wells, 2016), thus curtailing the ability to investigate or prosecute the case. Processing SAKs in cases that will not lead to any criminal proceedings/charges is arguably an inefficient use of limited resources (Davis et al., 2020). Second, in most sexual assault cases, the offender is known (Richards et al., 2019), and investigators may conclude that processing SAKs will not yield any probative value to those cases. Third, in some cases, offenders admit to the sexual assault. In cases where a confession is already obtained, the need for DNA evidence may be seen as unnecessary (Davis et al., 2020; Strom \u0026amp; Hickman, 2016). Fourth, investigators become accustomed to factors within cases that determine whether prosecutors will file charges. If the circumstances of a particular case do not meet those standards (i.e., a \u0026lsquo;trial sufficiency\u0026rsquo; standard), investigators may not submit a SAK in order to conserve agency resources. This is referred to as \u0026lsquo;downstream orientation\u0026rsquo; (Alderden \u0026amp; Ullman, 2012; Frohmann, 1991; Pattavina et al., 2016; Spohn \u0026amp; Tellis, 2019; Ylang \u0026amp; Holtfreter, 2019). Finally, investigators may not submit a SAK because they do not think the complainant is credible (Campbell et al., 2015; Davis et al., 2020; Hendrix et al., 2019).\nThere are, however, many theorized advantages to police investigators submitting all SAKs. First, by removing discretion for the submission of SAKs, the presence of extra-legal factors associated with stereotypes about \u0026lsquo;real rape\u0026rsquo; (Estrich, 1987; e.g., victim drug or alcohol use, sex worker status, and antecedent victim \u0026ldquo;risk-taking\u0026rdquo; behavior) that may bias investigators' decision-making are mitigated (Davis et al., 2020). A recent study identified these extra-legal characteristics as the primary influencers of investigator decisions to submit SAKs for testing, which the authors deem \u0026ldquo;justice denied for\u0026hellip;sexual assault victims whose fully collected SAKs were never submitted for analysis\u0026rdquo; (Valentine et al., 2019, p. 3565). Second, any obtained DNA evidence helps corroborate victims' statements, even if the suspect is already known or has confessed (Campbell et al., 2019; Campbell \u0026amp; Fehler-Cabral, 2019). Third, retrieval of DNA profiles from all sexual assault cases will result in the identification and (hopefully) arrest and prosecution of serial offenders (Campbell et al., 2019; Davis et al., 2020; Lovell et al., 2019). Finally, advocates of mandatory SAK testing policies argue arrests, prosecutions, and convictions of sex offenders in general will increase (Davis et al., 2020). This final argument found some empirical support after an additional 600 indictments and 400 convictions were associated with testing SAKs that had previously been backlogged in Cuyahoga County, Ohio (Lovell et al., 2018). What remains unclear is whether these same expectations hold for mandatory testing of new SAKs, a discussion we return to later.\nThere are convincing normative arguments for the viewpoints described above. However, the past decade has seen those advocating for mandatory testing policies gaining ground in the policy sphere. According to endthebacklog.org (2020), a program of the national nonprofit organization Joyful Heart Foundation, in 2019 alone, 103 bills were introduced in 35 states and Washington DC explicitly addressing concerns about the handling of SAKs. Further, 12 states have passed comprehensive SAK reform, including (1) inventorying and testing of all untested SAKs, and (2) timely testing of newly obtained SAKs.\nOutcome Evidence from Texas Given the evidence above, the question remains: do prospective mandatory testing policies achieve the desired outcomes? With the exception of identifying serial offenders (Campbell et al., 2019; Lovell et al., 2019), little work has been conducted to test these policies' outcomes. To our knowledge, only one other empirical test of prospective mandatory SAK testing policies has been undertaken. Davis et al. (2020) examined the policy outcomes of a compulsory statewide SAK testing law in Texas, otherwise known as Senate Bill 1636 (SB 1636). Texas was one of the first states to enact state legislation requiring the testing of all SAKs. In 2011, SB 1636 was passed, mandating that law enforcement agencies submit SAKs to a crime laboratory within 30 days of receipt. Advocates for the bill anticipated that it would lead to an increase in sexual assault reporting, as well as an increase in sexual assault arrests, prosecutions, and convictions.\nContrary to their hypotheses, Davis et al. (2020) did not find support for increased sexual assault reporting, sexual assault arrests, or sexual assault court filings and convictions across a 4-year pre- and post-policy implementation period. Davis et al. report that \u0026ldquo;[u]niversal testing of DNA in sexual assault cases, by itself, may be insufficient to promote meaningful changes in reporting and criminal justice system indicators that some may have expected\u0026rdquo; (p. 433). They identify inadequate crime laboratory funding as one primary possible reason for their null findings, as the crime laboratory was overwhelmed with the substantial increase in SAK submissions, resulting in lengthy turnaround times for analyses.\nAnother possible reason for Davis et al.\u0026rsquo;s (2020) null findings is that their study tests the effects of SB 1636 on the crimes of \u0026ldquo;sexual assault\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;aggravated sexual assault.\u0026rdquo; It is unclear from their study which specific crimes these terms encompass. Clear operationalization is vital when assessing the possible effects of mandatory testing policies because the term sexual assault can be ambiguous. That is, sexual assault encompasses not only rape but also other illegal behaviors, such as unwanted touching or sexual harassment in the workplace. When examining the effect of a mandatory SAK testing policy, specificity is critical. In the interest of greater specificity, we closely examine the effects of a mandatory testing policy on arrests for rape. Throughout this manuscript, we may reference \u0026ldquo;sexual assault\u0026rdquo; when discussing sexual violence in general, but when discussing the mandatory testing policy\u0026rsquo;s effects, we are explicitly referring to rape. Finally, Davis et al.\u0026rsquo;s (2020) study examined the effect of a mandatory SAK testing policy across an entire state, which may have masked important variation across jurisdictions therein. Our research examines one jurisdiction\u0026rsquo;s experience with mandatory SAK testing.\nThe Current Study In the current study, we focus on arrests for rape. While there are conflicting findings in the limited research literature examining whether analysis of previously untested SAKs leads to an increase in positive case outcomes (Campbell \u0026amp; Fehler-Cabral, 2019; Peterson et al., 2012), we examine the effects of requiring testing of all SAKs at the time they enter the criminal justice system. The only study that we are aware of that tested whether prospective mandatory SAK submission policies increase sexual assault arrests found that they do not (Davis et al., 2020).\nThere is some indication that SAK testing by crime laboratories enhances criminal justice processing of sexual assault cases (Valentine et al., 2019). However, it is unclear if improved case outcomes are because of the tested SAK itself, or if cases with tested SAKs are already more likely than other cases to result in positive case outcomes due to legal or extra-legal factors. Further, Davis et al. (2020) found a non-significant decreasing trend in sexual assault arrest rates in their study following implementation of a mandatory testing policy. Davis and colleagues indicated that this was possibly due to a failure to provide adequate resources for the entire investigatory system following the mandatory SAK testing policy (specifically crime laboratory resources). The jurisdiction we studied experienced a similar inadequacy of secondary resourcing upon policy implementation. With this in mind, we developed the following research hypothesis regarding the policy effect on the arrest rate for rape:\nHypothesis: Mandatory testing of SAKs will not lead to an increase in the proportion of rape reports that result in an arrest.\nData and Method Data We utilize reported crime and arrest data from an anonymous municipal police department that serves a capital city in the western United States (hereafter referred to as \u0026ldquo;Westland\u0026rdquo;). The Westland Police Department (WPD) provides full-spectrum policing services to a mixed urban core and suburban service area with an estimated nighttime population of 200,000 residents and a metropolitan population of over one million. The department employs approximately 600 sworn officers and has a specified unit within its investigation division responsible for investigating all sexual assault allegations (a special victims unit).\nIn 2014, WPD came under public criticism regarding past non-testing of SAKs for sexual assault investigations. From 2004 through 2013, approximately 77% of all SAKs received by WPD were never submitted to a crime laboratory for processing. As a result, and despite agency leadership arguing for a more limited policy, a city ordinance was passed, requiring all SAKs received by WPD be submitted to a crime laboratory for analysis within 30 days of receipt. The policy was implemented on November 1, 2014, and was effective immediately. This sharp implementation is a critical aspect of our research design, as it allows us to leverage the power of a natural experiment to analyze trends during the pre- and post-implementation periods. With immediate effect, every SAK that came into WPD\u0026rsquo;s special victims unit on or after November 1, 2014, was submitted to the state crime laboratory for testing. When a series of measures is broken up by the introduction of an intervention that occurs at a specific point in time, time-series analysis is appropriate (Davis et al., 2020; Shadish et al., 2002). The enactment of the mandatory SAK testing policy in Westland provides an opportunity for a time-series quasi-experiment to ascertain the impact (if any) of the policy on arrest rates for rape.\nMeasures Rape arrest rates. Our measure of rape arrest rates is constructed from agency-level data. By policy, at WPD a SAK is obtained whenever possible in all reported incidents of rape. This policy is because, unlike some forms of sexual assault, there is a high likelihood of obtaining biological evidence containing DNA after a rape is committed. When taking a sexual assault complaint, officers in Westland have to designate the type of crime being reported in the agency\u0026rsquo;s report writing system using a National Crime Information Center (NCIC) code. There are many designated codes related to crimes of sexual assault. For example, there are several sexual assault codes for child molestation, sexual assaults not involving penetration, rape, and more. By creating our measure with these codes at the agency level, we restrict our study to the crime of rape, as defined in the studied jurisdiction. The state in which Westland is located defines rape as \u0026ldquo;sexual intercourse with another person without the victim\u0026rsquo;s consent.\u0026rdquo; We documented the total number of rapes reported to WPD, along with the total number of arrests for rape, from 2010 through 2019, providing 120 monthly time-series measures. We defined an arrest as any instance in which a person was arrested, summoned to court, or had a warrant issued for their arrest. The arrest rate was calculated by dividing the number of arrests for rape in each month by the total number of rapes reported each month. Figure 1 displays the time-series data for rape arrests and reports in Westland.\nModel Description A Bayesian structural time-series model (BSTS) is a state-space time-series model that includes one component of state as a linear regression on the predictors. While we summarize the method below, a much more technical explanation of BSTS modeling is provided by Brodersen et al. (2015b), the developers of the method.\nConcisely, BSTS is best described as an observation equation, which links the observed data with an observed latent state and transition equation. The transition equation describes the development of the latent state over time. The observation equation is defined as $$y_t = Z_t^T α_t + ε_t$$\nwhere $y_t$ is a scalar observation (i.e., arrest rate), $Z_t$ is an output vector, and $α_t$ is the unobserved latent state; $ε_t ~ N(0, σ_t^2)$ is independent of all other unknowns and is a scalar observation error with variance $σ_t$.\nThe transition equation is defined as $$α_(t+1) = T_t α_t+ R_t η_t$$\nwhere $α_t$ is the unobserved latent state, $T_t$ is the transition matrix, and $R_t$ is the control matrix; $η_t \\sim N(0, Q_t)$ is independent of all other unknowns and describes the system error with a state-diffusion matrix $Q_t$. $R_t η_t$ allows the inclusion of seasonality in the analysis.\nBSTS models infer causal impact by predicting the counterfactual treatment response in a synthetic control that would have occurred if no intervention had taken place. That is, rather than comparing the experimental group to a nonequivalent control group, BSTS models use a synthetic control to construct the counterfactual to estimate the treatment effect. This synthetic control is constructed by using the time-series behavior of the experimental group prior to and after the intervention, as well as combining control variables that are predictive of the target series prior to the intervention. As long as the control variables did not receive the intervention, it is reasonable to assume the relationship between the treatment and the control variables that existed prior to the intervention would continue if the treatment had no effect. As such, a plausible estimate of the counterfactual time-series can be estimated up to the point where the relationship between treatment and controls are no longer stationary because of the treatment (Brodersen et al., 2015c; de Vocht et al., 2017; Liu \u0026amp; Fabbri, 2016; Ratcliffe et al., 2017).\nUse of BSTS models are ideal for social science (Brodersen et al., 2015b), and have been used successfully in other criminological studies to estimate violence reduction as a result of gang arrests (Ratcliffe et al., 2017); the deterrence effect of unarmed private patrols (Liu \u0026amp; Fabbri, 2016); and the effect alcohol licensing policies have on crime (de Vocht et al., 2017). Further, BSTS models are preferred to Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models when examining crime data because crime data is low-volume count data, which may be inappropriate for ARIMA modeling (Ratcliffe et al., 2017).\nCounterfactual predictor. A key component of utilizing BSTS modeling is the identification of appropriate predictors. Predictors are linearly regressed onto the observed values, creating the composite synthetic control series (Brodersen et al., 2015b; Ratcliffe et al., 2017). To build the synthetic control for the time-series, we turn to other violent crimes. It is well established that violent crimes tend to track with each other across time (Latzer, 2016; Lonsway \u0026amp; Archambault, 2012; Yung, 2013). To ascertain whether arrest rates for rape are associated with arrest rates for other violent crimes in Westland, we examined the arrest rates for aggravated assault, domestic violence aggravated assault, simple assault, robbery, and homicide. We found that the arrest rates for aggravated assault and domestic violence aggravated assault most closely mirrored the arrest rate for rape from January 2010 through October 2014 (the pre-intervention time-period). We plot the arrest rate for rape with the arrest rates for aggravated assault and domestic violence aggravated assault in Westland in Figure 2.\nBased on the above analysis, the arrest rates for aggravated assault and domestic violence aggravated assault in Westland are utilized to construct the synthetic control. Importantly, the arrest rate for aggravated assault and domestic violence aggravated assault would not plausibly be affected by the mandatory SAK testing policy. Moreover, as mentioned previously, WPD employs a specialized detective unit to investigate all sexual assaults. As such, detectives investigating aggravated assaults (investigated by a violent crimes unit at WPD) and domestic violence aggravated assault (investigated by a domestic violence unit at WPD) would not be affected by this policy. Thus, any change in the rate of arrests for rape that is not also observed in the rate of arrests for either of the aggravated assault categories may reasonably be attributed to the mandatory submission policy.\nAnalysis and Results We used the R package CausalImpact (Brodersen et al., 2015a) to conduct the analysis. The model uses a response variable comprised of the monthly arrest rate for rape, and the predictor variables: the arrest rates for aggravated assault and domestic violence aggravated assault. The BSTS model was structured to allow for a seasonal parameter to reflect any yearly cyclical behavior on the arrest rate for rape (Mcdowall et al., 2012; Mcdowall \u0026amp; Curtis, 2015).\nThe pre-intervention time series began in January 2010 and ended in October 2014, as the mandatory SAK testing policy was enacted on November 1, 2014. The post-intervention time-series began in November 2014 and continued through December of 2019. Accordingly, the pre-intervention series is 58 data points in length, with a post-intervention length of 62 months. Ten thousand Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples were drawn for the analysis in each model. Ninety-five percent Bayesian posterior distribution credible intervals were generated. Results for the model assessing change in the arrest rate for rape are presented in Figure 3.\n\rThe frequentist analog to a credible interval is a confidence interval, yet the two concepts are statistically different. In a frequentist paradigm, confidence intervals are based on repeated sampling theory. A 95% confidence interval indicates that 95 out of 100 replications of exactly the same experiment will capture the fixed, but unknown, regression coefficient. A credible interval can be interpreted as the probability that the population parameter is between the upper and lower bounds of the credible interval, based on the available information (Van de Schoot \u0026amp; Depaoli, 2014).\n\rFigure 3 contains three panels. The panel labeled \u0026ldquo;original\u0026rdquo; shows the data and a counterfactual prediction for the post-treatment period. The counterfactual prediction is the horizontal dashed line, with a corresponding 95% credible interval surrounding it. The solid line represents the observed data. The panel labeled \u0026ldquo;pointwise\u0026rdquo; represents the pointwise causal effect, as estimated by the model. That is, it shows the difference between observed data and counterfactual predictions. The panel labeled \u0026ldquo;cumulative\u0026rdquo; visualizes the cumulative effect of the intervention post-treatment by summing the pointwise contributions from the second panel. The dashed vertical line represents the intervention date (i.e., November 2014).\nTable 1: Causal Impact Posterior Inference\n    Average SD 95% CI     Actual Arrest Rate 0.097     Predicted Arrest Rate 0.120 0.045 [0.029, 0.200]         Absolute Effect -0.018 0.045 [-0.110, 0.069]   Relative Effect -16% 39% [-92%, 59%]    As indicated in Table 1, the enactment of the mandatory SAK submission policy at WPD was associated with a decrease in the arrest rate for rape. During the post-intervention period, the arrest rate for rape had an average value of .097. By contrast, in the absence of an intervention, we would have expected a counterfactual average of .120. The 95% credible interval of the counterfactual prediction is [0.029, 0.200]. Subtracting this prediction from the observed response yields an estimate of the absolute causal effect the intervention had on the arrest rate for rape (-.018), resulting in a 16% relative decrease. The posterior probability of the observed negative effect is .66. In other words, although it appears the intervention may have exerted a negative effect on the arrest rate for rape, the effect is not statistically significant by conventional standards (i.e., the probability of obtaining this effect by chance is .34). In sum, we observed a downward trend that departs from the counterfactual we estimated. However, we cannot say with a considerable probability that the observed negative trend was a result of the policy implementation. The most conservative interpretation is that, consistent with our hypothesis, the policy implementation did not have an effect on rape arrest rates.\nDiscussion There have been calls within academic, advocacy, and policy circles over the past several years to increase accountability for those who commit sexual violence (Sacco \u0026amp; James, 2015; Valentine et al., 2019; Watkins, 2019). One proposed policy intervention to meet these appeals is that of mandatory SAK testing policies. It has been theorized that requiring all SAKs to be submitted to crime labs for DNA analysis will increase the ability to identify and hold offenders accountable (Campbell et al., 2019; Campbell \u0026amp; Fehler-Cabral, 2019; Davis et al., 2020; Lovell et al., 2019; Valentine et al., 2019).\nIn search of these desirable outcomes, as of 2019, 12 states have passed comprehensive SAK reform, which includes mandatory testing of newly obtained SAKs (Endthebacklog.org, 2020). Methodologically rigorous evaluations of these policies are scant (Hendrix et al., 2019; Strom \u0026amp; Hickman, 2016), but absolutely critical. If mandatory testing policies are not producing the desired results, further investigation is necessary to understand if and how policies could be amended or supplemented to better achieve the desired results. That is, if arrest rates for sexual assault are not increasing, there must be other determinative factors at play that should be addressed.\nIn this study, we examined the above question. We tested the effect of a mandatory SAK testing policy on the arrest rate for rapes in one jurisdiction after a mandatory SAK testing policy was implemented. We accomplished this by using a Bayesian structural time-series model with 120 longitudinal data points. As hypothesized, our model found that the mandatory SAK testing policy did not lead to an increase in the arrest rate for rape, but instead had a null, or possibly a negative, effect (probability = .66).\nIt appears then, at least in Westland, a mandatory SAK testing policy did not have the effect of increasing the arrest rate for rapes\u0026mdash;an often-stated goal of those who advocate for such policies (Davis et al., 2020). The implementation of mandatory testing policies \u0026ldquo;is not merely to test rape kits, but to investigate and prosecute the reported sexual assaults associated with these kits\u0026rdquo; (Campbell \u0026amp; Fehler-Cabral, 2019, p. 2). We agree. We call attention to several other studies, as well as anecdotal evidence obtained from conversations with the investigators at WPD, to help explain these findings.\nThe only other similar study we are aware of examines the effect of a statewide mandatory submission policy in Texas. Davis et al. (2020) found that implementing a statewide mandatory SAK submission policy did not increase sexual assault arrests or convictions, but did increase the workload for investigators and crime laboratories.\n\rWhile not statistically significant, much like our analysis Davis et al. (2020) finds a general decrease in the sexual assault arrest rate after the mandatory testing policy implementation.\n\rThe large influx of SAKs for testing created a backlog for incoming cases (not to be confused with previously untested kits). Through interviews with sexual assault investigators and crime lab personnel, Davis and colleagues found that after implementation of the mandatory testing policy, completion of analysis for newly incoming SAKs was taking 10-11 months. Investigators stated that having to wait up to a year for SAK analysis results commonly prompted victims to drop out of the criminal justice process. Davis et al. warn that mandated testing may be insufficient to promote meaningful changes without sufficient additional funding directed to the affected agencies.\nDavis et al.\u0026rsquo;s (2020) description of underfunded crime laboratory resources following a mandatory SAK testing policy is mirrored in the state where Westland is located. In 2017, the state legislature passed a new state law, mandating submission of all SAKs throughout the state, effective immediately (much like the municipal SAK policy implemented solely in Westland in 2014). During the 2018 legislative session, news stories reported that the state crime laboratory could not keep up with testing demand. In response, the state legislature gave law enforcement agencies slightly expanded time frames to come into compliance. In 2020, the state crime laboratory requested millions in additional funding due to a 535% increase in SAK submissions between 2012 and 2019.\nHendrix et al. (2019) also call attention to a lack of resources for SAK testing. While they did not test the implementation of a mandatory testing policy specifically, their findings are instructive. Hendrix et al. found that a lack of resources primarily drives non-submission of SAKs by agencies without mandatory testing policies. The researchers found that the most important resource input, when attempting to increase the use of SAKs, is increasing the number of detectives assigned to investigating sexual assault cases. In their study, SAK submission increased 24% for every 100% increase in detectives.\nAdditionally, a common explanation for not submitting a SAK was the inability of crime labs to produce timely results. This limitation is relevant to our findings for the following reasons. Based on Hendrix et al.\u0026rsquo;s findings, voluntary investigative submission of SAKs rises with increased investigatory resources. However, a continuing reason to not submit SAKs is the inability of crime laboratories to provide timely turnaround on analyses, a concern echoed elsewhere (e.g., Strom \u0026amp; Hickman, 2016). Policies may be implemented that require all SAKs to be submitted, but without an adequate increase in resources for investigators and the crime laboratories responsible for analyzing the submitted SAKs, mandatory policies may harm victims in the sense that both investigating agencies and crime labs are logistically overwhelmed. This logjam may increase turnaround time on SAK analyses, and thus increase turnaround time on the entire investigation. The lengthy timeline between victim reporting and law enforcement action may lead to frustration from victims, and ultimately their withdrawal from the justice process (Kääriäinen \u0026amp; Sirén, 2011; Tarling \u0026amp; Morris, 2010).\nAnecdotal evidence from interviews with investigators at WPD lends credence to this possibility. Before mandatory SAK submission policy implementation, investigators were already waiting extended periods for SAK DNA analysis results, ranging from six months to one year. Following the policy implementation, the average turnaround time for SAK DNA analyses increased to between eighteen months to two years. Investigators reported victim withdrawal due to these ever-growing wait times for SAK testing. The increased delay overlapped with a substantial increase in investigatory resources. From the policy implementation to 2018, the detective unit responsible for investigating sexual assaults increased by a third\u0026mdash;from six detectives to eight detectives. Three additional detectives have been added since 2018, indicating WPD is still attempting to balance its investigative resources. At the least, the nearly doubling of detectives in the special victims unit since policy implementation suggests that whatever mechanism drives the stagnant (or decreasing) arrest rate is not related to a decrease in the number of investigators.\nIt must be considered that perhaps submission of all SAKs simply does not provide the additional evidence needed to increase accountability for sexual assault offenders. While several studies indicate that testing SAKs is associated with positive case outcomes (Valentine et al., 2019), it must be remembered that the vast majority of sexual assault cases involve known perpetrators (Richards et al., 2019). If the hope is that DNA analysis from SAKs will increase arrest and prosecution for sexual assaults, expectations may need to be tempered. That is, DNA evidence is not especially helpful when prosecutors are trying to prove a lack of consent (Spohn \u0026amp; Tellis, 2014). While an increase in DNA profiles in CODIS will likely assist in identifying serial rapists, DNA evidence from non-serial sexual assaults where the suspect is known and claims consent may not provide the benefit desired by proponents of mandatory SAK submission policies.\nFinally, it should also be considered that investigator discretion was interpreting the \u0026lsquo;downstream orientation\u0026rsquo; of prosecuting entities correctly in the majority of sexual assault cases (Alderden \u0026amp; Ullman, 2012; Frohmann, 1991; Richards et al., 2019; Spohn \u0026amp; Tellis, 2014, 2019). Prosecutorial discretion is a major source of influence in the handling of criminal cases (Mourtgos \u0026amp; Adams, 2019; Pfaff, 2017). While calls for improved sexual assault investigatory practices (Campbell et al., 2019; Campbell \u0026amp; Fehler-Cabral, 2019; Goodman-Williams \u0026amp; Campbell, 2019; Valentine et al., 2019) are warranted, perhaps additional attention should be paid to prosecutorial handling of sexual assault cases. So, while SAK testing may be mandated, and investigatory resources may be expanded and improved, increased accountability for sexual assault perpetrators remains dampened if sexual assault cases are not charged and prosecuted.\nPolicymakers, victims, and the public should continue to demand that sexual assault investigations receive full and proper treatment. SAK testing policies are a necessary component, but as our results show, mandating SAK testing is not sufficient on its own. We join Davis et al. (2020) in their emphasis on recommending elevated funding of the system around sexual assault investigations. If adequate funding and resources are not provided to the investigating agencies and crime laboratories concurrently with these policies, increased offender accountability is unlikely to occur, as outlined in our study, as well as other empirical research (Davis et al., 2020). Also, resources must be invested in other \u0026lsquo;victim-facing\u0026rsquo; services, particularly victim advocates who serve as liaisons between victims and the criminal justice system (Rich \u0026amp; Seffrin, 2013). Research demonstrates that victim advocates are associated with positive victim outcomes, including victim engagement with law enforcement and prosecutors (Patterson \u0026amp; Campbell, 2010).\nGiven that mandatory SAK testing is likely associated with increased wait times, victim advocates may be critical to keeping victims informed, and thus engaged in the process. Other potential components of a holistic approach to SAKs include online tracking systems that allow victims to follow the progress of their SAK in real-time without having to work through law enforcement officers or victim services (Carlisle, 2019). Again, given the historical undertesting of SAKs, increased criminal justice system transparency is likely critical to building and sustaining trust from victims of sexual assault.\nLimitations and Future Research We contribute important findings to this nascent body of knowledge, but this research is not without limitations. First, this study looks at a single jurisdiction. WPD is a large agency with approximately 600 sworn officers, with jurisdiction of a major metropolitan capital city in the Western US, and with a dedicated special victims unit. Though our results build on similar findings (Davis et al., 2020), that study also took place in a Western US state. To the degree that there may be regional differences, it is not clear how our findings will generalize to other parts of the US, or to smaller, exurban, suburban, and rural communities. We suspect that given the more considerable resources available to large metropolitan police forces, and the greater specialization of investigators found there, non-metropolitan jurisdictions may see negative effects of even greater magnitude and certainty than found in our study. However, that question must be answered in future research.\nA second limitation is related to the scope of our research. We do not propose or pursue a full accounting of the costs, benefits, outputs, and outcomes of the mandatory SAK testing policy, but restrict our analysis to the primary indicator of clearance by arrest of rape cases. There are likely other benefits and costs incurred by the policy, and we encourage a fuller accounting in future work. Related to both generalizability and scope concerns, our single jurisdiction is located in a state that only recently passed a law mandating SAK testing across the state. While we are not able to analyze the results of that statewide law, we encourage other researchers to pursue similar research and build the empirical foundation for understanding the effect of mandatory SAK testing policies and laws. For a host of ethical and logistical reasons, it is not likely that a true randomized control trial will be available. As demonstrated here, Bayesian structural time-series provides an accessible and relatively easy method to leverage the implementation of those policies with natural experimental designs.\nConclusion Mandatory testing of SAKs has been rapidly adopted in criminal justice investigations, but to date, the empirical record for understanding the effects of those policies has been extremely limited. Our findings suggest that following implementation of such a policy, the arrest rate in cases most likely to result in a SAK being performed showed, at best, no change, and a substantial probability of a decrease. These outcomes should give policy makers and police administrators pause. They suggest that going forward, a substantial increase in resources is necessary across the investigative and victim service systems before the desired change in criminal justice system outcomes are realized. Further, reforms and policy changes other than mandatory SAK testing policies are likely required to increase accountability for sexual assault offenders.\n\\newpage\nReferences Alderden, M.

We use a Bayesian structural time-series model and monthly data on arrests for rape from 2010 through 2019. In the post-implementation period, we observed a downward trend in the arrest rate for rape. Based on the results, the most conservative interpretation of our findings is that the policy implementation did not affect rape arrest rates. While mandatory SAK testing policies are often advocated for based on the belief that they will increase arrest rates for sexual assault (among other proposed benefits), we add to growing empirical evidence that policy interventions beyond mandatory SAK testing are needed to increase arrest rates for sexual assault. Jurisdictions that currently use mandatory SAK testing policies are encouraged to assess stakeholders’ experiences to proactively address resource allocation, consider other policies that may increase accountability for sexual assault offenders, and utilize victim service providers to support other measures of success with victims in instances where no arrest is made.","tags":[],"title":"Mandatory Sexual Assault Kit Testing Policies and Arrest Trends a Natural Experiment","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":["R"],"content":"\r\rI saw the scholar package has a new maintainer on Github, so thought I’d do a quick run through of what’s available in the vignette.

Clear-cut agency policy, such as mandating recording all public contacts, arrests, and probable use-of-force, will increase BWC activation.\n  Officers with sharper levels of concern that BWC\u0026rsquo;s reduce their professional discretion, or expose them to public hatred and outrage, are likely to activate the cameras less often.\n  To the extent possible, public safety administrators should adopt model policies on BWC activation and communicate their support for difficult discretionary decision-making by frontline officers.\n  Nearly two-thirds of officers activate their camera more often than predicted by the best performing model. This indicates that BWC policy effectively sets a \u0026ldquo;floor\u0026rdquo; of minimum activation standards and that overall, officers will record more often than required.\n   Introduction  Sergeant: Which side do you want?\nOfficer: Usually, the better-looking girls are on the other side.\nSergeant: The church girls?\nOfficer: Yeah, church girls are a little cleaner, at least.\n[pause]\nOfficer: That\u0026rsquo;s on that body cam already. I\u0026rsquo;m already in trouble. I\u0026rsquo;ve been here two minutes. Nice.\n Body-worn cameras (BWCs) are a workplace surveillance technology, forming the new normal in US policing. Increasingly adopted internationally, BWCs are now migrating to other public sector contexts, including medical services (Knapton and Walker 2017), public schools (Adams 2020), and public transit (Ariel et al. 2019). This expansion of BWCs to other public sector contexts is an opportunity to synthesize the BWC literature with public administration scholarship on administrative discretion, to better prepare public managers for BWC implementation challenges.\nThe evidence so far is weighted towards some positive outcomes from BWC adoption (Lum et al. 2019; White and Malm 2020), but in some cases, the lack of effect has raised the question of whether officer discretion in activating the cameras is to blame. There is some evidence that citizens also distrust leaving the decision to activate a BWC in officers' hands (Bromberg, Charbonneau, and Smith 2018).\nThe Rialto Study (Ariel, Farrar, and Sutherland 2015) provided first-of-its-kind results indicating a substantial reduction in use-of-force and public complaints when police officers are equipped with BWCs. The results from Rialto were found to persist well past the initial experimental period, though questions remain about the context of the department and whether there was something \u0026ldquo;special\u0026rdquo; about the agency (Sutherland et al. 2017; Gaub and White 2020) that led to large magnitude effects not often seen in other agencies' experience with BWCs. For example, in 2007 the city council had voted to disband the Rialto Police Department in favor of contracting for police services with the San Bernardino Sheriff\u0026rsquo;s Office (Kelly and Reston 2007). A new chief, Tony Farrar, was hired in 2011, and later was an author and primary investigator in the Rialto Study. These factors may point to a department at a \u0026ldquo;low point,\u0026rdquo; and that the rapid decreases in use-of-force and complaints were at least partially attributable to sources other than BWCs (see Gaub and White 2020 for a broad discussion of agency context and BWCs).\nSome US agencies had begun limited experimenting with BWCs before the Rialto study (Miller and Toliver 2014) for varied but consistent reasons, including improvements to officer safety, reduced civilian complaints, and reduced agency liability (Hyland 2018). The Rialto study\u0026rsquo;s promising results were the subject of high media coverage (Schneider 2018) and highlighted in President Obama\u0026rsquo;s 21st Century Policing report (President\u0026rsquo;s Task Force, 2015), which recommended BWCs across US policing in order to enhance community trust in police. That recommendation was bolstered by federal funding to purchase BWCs for law enforcement agencies (Edwards 2015). Widespread implementation accelerated across the US beginning in 2015, and by 2018 an estimated 64% of large agencies were using BWCs (Nix, Todak, and Tregle 2020).\nWith wide BWC implementation came expectations of greater transparency and accountability for police actions (Lum et al. 2019; 2020). However, \u0026ldquo;BWCs will have a minimal deterrent effect when officers have broad discretion around activating their cameras\u0026rdquo; (Peterson and Lawrence 2019, 8). If officers deliberately fail to activate their BWCs to avoid their departments and communities' surveillant gaze, then bad behavior will not be deterred. If, however, officers are good stewards of their profession and follow department policies, then job function\u0026ndash;the actual work of an officer, guided by agency policy, assignment, and oversight\u0026mdash;and not individual characteristics of officers or their attitudes about BWCs will predict activations. This article tests competing explanations for the exercise of discretion in policing, a high-stakes context for administrative discretion.\nReview of the Literature: Administrative Discretion and Body-Worn Cameras If the purpose of BWCs is to monitor officer behavior, why are cameras not always recording? Or if cameras must be activated manually, why give the officer discretion over that decision? Discretion in public decision-making is at once a threat to democracy (Aberbach and Rockman 1988; Finer 1941), a source of social and economic inequality (Cárdenas and Cruz 2017), and yet a fact of administrative life (Sowa and Selden 2003). Imperfect oversight means that \u0026ldquo;responsible conduct of administrative functions is not so much enforced as it is elicited\u0026rdquo; (Friedrich 1940, 9).\nEarly evidence from a study in Phoenix, Arizona (Katz et al. 2015) found that within a discretionary policy framework, activation rates for BWCs was relatively low, at under 30% overall, and that activation rates declined over time to a low of 13.2% by the end of the study. This evidence was supported by a one-year study in Mesa, Arizona (Young and Ready 2016), which compared two cohorts of BWC-equipped officers under a mandatory activation policy versus a discretionary policy. When officers were allowed more discretion, activation rates fell by 27%, though this negative effect was more pronounced for officers who were mandated to wear the cameras compared to those who volunteered to do so. Further, a multi-site study that included both US and European study sites found that BWCs increased assaults against officers (Ariel et al. 2016b). The authors returned with further analysis showing that treatment fidelity had been compromised in the original study. The secondary analysis (Ariel et al. 2017) theorized that unplanned, \u0026ldquo;strong\u0026rdquo; discretion in some study sites had backfired, leading to increased use-of-force, suggesting that BWC policies should seek some optimal deterrence point that allows for some officer discretion, but with a strong assumption for recording of most police-public interactions.\nOfficers receive training on BWCs and activation guidance (Gaub et al. 2020). Agency policy determines when and what must and must not be recorded (White and Malm 2020), but in the field (Leys 1943; Simon 1944), it is up to the officer to decide whether to activate their BWC or not. Procedural controls are only partially effective in curbing discretion (Spence 1999). At the time of this writing, file storage costs prohibit municipalities from practicing an always-on BWC policy, and remote or automatic camera activation is not yet widespread.\nStreet-level bureaucrats in law enforcement possess the power to use lethal force in the discharge of their duties. Better understanding what drives BWC activation in a discretionary environment can lead to improved training, policy, and auditing related to BWCs. Understanding the forces competing for control of an officer\u0026rsquo;s discretion is the first step in structuring theories of controlling that discretion (Mastrofski 2004), and can lead to improved training, policy, and auditing related to BWCs.\nBWC Activations as High-Stakes Administrative Discretion Police work \u0026ldquo;entails a tension between the exercise of discretion by officers on the street and the control of that discretion by police organizations\u0026rdquo; (Engel and Worden 2003, 131). Understanding officer discretion has been a long-standing concern of researchers (Davis 1975; Goldstein 1963). Discretion is at the core of the professional police identity (Bayley 2011; Crank 2014), which itself is a primary component of officer performance and wellbeing (Schaible 2018). Both Wilson (1968) and Bittner (1970) provide foundational explanations for understanding the necessity of police discretion. Discretion is the necessary leeway granted to police because that is the only reasonable tool to effectively deal with the situational exigencies encountered by police (Bittner 1970). Early exploration of a theory of street-level bureaucracy (Lipsky 1980) was built atop an attempt to understand police discretion in use-of-force, and how those decisions both imperil and produce justice (Lipsky 1973). The first systematic study of police shootings (Fyfe 1979) found that officers' discretion could be constrained with policy changes, and Rohr (1989) saw administrative discretion as the critical ethical issue faced by public servants. Police officers must balance ethical considerations even in non-violent encounters, such as DUI enforcement (Mastrofski, Ritti, and Snipes 1994), and discretionary behavior is tightly coupled with the administrative priorities of the agency (Mastrofski, Ritti, and Hoffmaster 2002).\nDespite its value to both the institution of policing and members of the policing profession, discretion is often viewed negatively, as a confounding tendency to undermine agency policy (Tummers and Bekkers 2014) or research designs (Ariel et al. 2016a). When misused, officer discretion can become a legalistic excuse to perpetuate social inequities. Thus, \u0026ldquo;while street-level worker judgment is necessary and ever-present, it is fundamentally illegitimate unless operating within specific, juridical bounds\u0026rdquo; (Maynard-Moody and Musheno 2000, S18). As agencies and communities seek greater control over outcomes, officers' ability to exercise discretion decreases (Shane 2019). However, with an increase in policy complexity, officers may opt to simply record everything, even in situations where policy encourages the primacy of privacy over evidentiary value (Newell and Greidanus 2018).\nFailure to activate BWCs can have adverse consequences, particularly in instances of police using lethal force. Two officers involved in the police killing of Breonna Taylor did not activate their BWCs during the incident, enhancing public anger and leading to both officers being placed on administrative leave (Madani 2020) and intense community concern. Not all failures to activate are intentional, and technological limitations, the immediacy of some incidents, and unfamiliarity with the technology can lead to otherwise recordable incidents going unrecorded. While still not widely implemented, fully automatic activations of BWCs could alleviate the question of officer discretion (White and Malm 2020). However, in jurisdictions with broad public access to police recordings, there are significant questions about the impact on privacy for both police and the public (see Newell and Greidanus 2018, for an early discussion of similar concerns). The tension between agency control and individual discretion could manifest as the officer\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;failure to activate a BWC limits the potential benefits of the technology,\u0026rdquo; including the presumed positives of increased transparency, legitimacy, and community trust (Lawrence et al. 2019, 1). Thus, the concern arises: Do officers comply with department policy, or rely on their attitudes towards the cameras in decisions to activate BWCs?\nBWC Activations: A Principal-Agent Problem, or Principled Agents? BWC policies vary widely (see White and Malm 2020 for a current review). Where policies do exist, there are mandatory and prohibited times for activation and a messy middle where officers are granted broad discretion. For example, most departments mandate activation when use-of-force is expected and prohibit activation where a juvenile victim of a sex crime is interviewed. But: \u0026ldquo;Three-quarters of policies allow officer discretion in activation, if mandatory and prohibited criteria are not in play\u0026rdquo; (White and Malm 2020, 61). Making novel use of the metadata contained within BWC footage, Martain, Harinam, and Ariel (2020) analyze over 1.7 million BWC activations from 6333 officers, and found an activation compliance rate of 82.7%. However, this relatively high number is disproportionately affected by multiple activations at the same call, and the authors show that activation is heterogenous, and 55.7% of officers activated their camera one or fewer times over the course of a year. We return to this distinction between over- and under-activators later in the paper.\nCompeting views of discretion in BWC activation emerge. First, in the principal-agent literature (Brehm and Gates 1999; Miller 2005), public servants may act according to personal desires and attitudes rather than guided by their \u0026lsquo;principals,\u0026rsquo; the agency, and the community (Bell et al. 2020). Scholars have applied the principal-agent explanation in policing, with a pessimistic view regarding \u0026ldquo;the ability of rules and supervision to shape officer behavior, citing officer \u0026lsquo;predispositions\u0026rsquo; and the difficulty of observing police activity\u0026rdquo; (Mummolo 2018, 18). Officers can undermine policy through \u0026ldquo;their ability to turn [BWCs] off or position a partner to block the view-finder frame\u0026rdquo; (Kerrison, Cobbina, and Bender 2018, 281). Wallace et al. (2018, 486) trace theoretical factors, including \u0026ldquo;motivational issues, increased scrutiny, function creep, and the negative relationship between employee surveillance and counterproductive workplace behavior\u0026rdquo; that may influence officers to be wary of BWCs. Though Wallace et al. eventually find BWCs do not induce the passivity (de-policing) the researchers focused on, it may be that similar factors shape BWC activation. That is, a principal-agent perspective predicts officers with cynical attitudes towards BWCs will activate less frequently.\n\u0026lsquo;Principled Agent\u0026rsquo; theory argues that principal-agent theory explains the relatively rare instances where public employees chase self-interest to subvert principals' goals. However, it cannot explain what motivates public employees to \u0026ldquo;perform thankless tasks, go above and beyond the call of duty, and make virtual gifts of their labor even when the rewards for behaving that way are highly uncertain at best\u0026rdquo; (Dilulio 1994, 277). Likewise, policing research finds weak or non-existent links between officer attitudes and behavioral outcomes: Arrest decisions are not predicted by job satisfaction (Smith and Klein 1983), nor DUI arrests by attitudes about enforcement (Mastrofski, Ritti, and Snipes 1994; Meyers, Heeren, and Hingson 1989). Officer attitudes towards domestic violence are not linked to domestic violence arrests (Stith 1990), and attitudes fail to predict officers' coercive behavior (Terrill and Mastrofski 2002). Engel and Worden (2003) find no link between officer attitude and behavior, concluding that department policy and supervision better predict officers' decision-making. More recently, Mummolo (2018) shows that New York City police officers were responsive to a sudden change in the department\u0026rsquo;s approach to stop-and-frisk, even while some officer attitudes aligned against the policy change.\nYoung and Ready (2016, 35) provide BWC activation evidence for the Principled Agent view: \u0026ldquo;When practical, officers will make every effort to activate the on-officer body camera when responding to a call or have any contact with the public.\u0026rdquo; But other research contradicts this result (Lawrence et al. 2019). In a department mandating recording in 100% of police interactions with the public, activations ranged between 0% and 71.43%, with a mean of 24.99%. Call type and experience predict activation, and the authors suggest that future research examine officer attitudes towards BWCs, which may \u0026ldquo;influence how an officer uses this technology\u0026rdquo; (Lawrence et al. 2019, 14).\nBody-Worn Camera Research BWC studies have increased fourteenfold (Lum et al. 2019; White and Malm 2020) in less than a decade. Many studies have centered on the effects of BWCs on police use-of-force and citizen complaints. The literature has not coalesced around straightforward answers, however, and the \u0026ldquo;anticipated effects from BWCs have been overestimated\u0026rdquo; (Lum et al. 2019, 20). While seven of nineteen studies reveal statistically-significant reductions in use-of-force by police officers wearing cameras (White and Malm 2020), none have established a magnitude of effect similar to the Rialto Study (Ariel, Farrar, and Sutherland 2015), and twelve found no reduction in use-of-force.\nStudies investigating the impact of BWCs on police use-of-force and other outcomes have not produced clear answers. The basis for expecting such a change is deterrence theory. Proponents contend cameras deter officers from engaging in use-of-force: As \u0026ldquo;the degree of deterrence increases, officers are less likely to use force\u0026rdquo; (Ariel et al. 2017, 2). However, officers do not consider lawful use-of-force to be illegitimate, even while some public opinion diverges from legalistic views (Mourtgos and Adams 2019). While there may be a deterrent effect on illegitimate and excessive force, that has not been measured in body-camera experiments. This mismatch may explain why the most extensive experimental study of BWCs, the Washington DC study, did not detect a single statistically-significant effect on any outcome, including use-of-force. The result prompted the authors to advise \u0026ldquo;we should recalibrate our expectations\u0026rdquo; regarding BWCs (Yokum, Ravishankar, and Coppock 2019, 22). As BWC research proceeds, White and Malm (2020, 136) predict: \u0026ldquo;Some of those [BWC] stories will be like Rialto\u0026rsquo;s. Some will be like Washington DC\u0026rsquo;s. And most will likely be somewhere in between.\u0026rdquo; Going forward, White and Malm (2020) recommend careful attention be paid to officer attitudes towards BWCs.\nPolice Attitudes Towards BWCs Lum et al. (2019) identify at least thirty-two articles investigating officer attitudes towards BWCs, up from thirteen studies reviewed four years earlier (Lum et al. 2015). The officer-attitude literature consistently finds that as officers gain experience with BWCs, their perceptions become more positive despite early skepticism and negativity (Fouche 2014; Gaub et al. 2016; Jennings, Fridell, and Lynch 2014; Snyder, Crow, and Smykla 2019; White, Todak, and Gaub 2018; Todak and Gaub 2019). Officers may find BWCs useful in public complaint and internal affairs investigations (Fouche 2014; Goetschel and Peha 2017; Owens and Finn 2017; Pelfrey and Keener 2016), evidence collection (Gaub, Todak, and White 2018; White, Todak, and Gaub 2018), and improving job performance (Gramagila and Phillips 2017).\nOne explanation for officers' negative attitudes is that BWCs curb discretion or impose a hesitancy to use force, even when justified. Dubbed the \u0026ldquo;over-deterrent\u0026rdquo; effect, this phenomenon has been documented experimentally (Ariel, Sutherland, and Henstock 2018). Other research links officer attitudes towards BWCs to organizational factors. Adams and Mastracci (2019b) confirm perceived organizational support mediates burnout experienced by officers equipped with BWCs. Perceptions of organizational justice also shape BWC attitudes (Kyle and White 2017), though three other studies (Huff, Katz, and Webb 2018; Lawshe et al. 2018; Todak and Gaub 2019) find no link. Adams and Mastracci (2019a) sidestep whether officers like BWCs and instead construct the Perceived Intensity of Monitoring (PIM) scale, which captures officer perceptions on professional discretion, the capture of personal or embarrassing information by cameras, and the degree to which officer interests are taken into account when releasing footage publicly. The PIM scale connects to concerns about BWCs by officers, along dimensions of how the technology is perceived to affect them professionally and personally. In the studied agency, BWCs are mandated, not optional, so preference for wearing one is beside the point, and the PIM scale items represent realistic concerns of officers that may inhibit camera activation.\nMethods, Hypotheses, and Data Analytic Plan This is an exploratory, hypothesis-generating study of a single agency (Gerring and Cojocaru 2016), interested in explaining what accounts for variation in BWC activations. Building upon a null model of demographic measures, we separately model the collection of Job Function and Attitudinal measures. Inter-model reporting allows us to make conclusions about the significance and direction of individual correlates, and confirm or reject the hypotheses developed below. Intra-model comparisons of model fit, explanatory power, and likelihood statistics further allow for theory building in BWC activation, with the overall goal of litigating between conceptions of officers' BWC activations as principal-agent problems, or principled agents acting as directed by agency policy.\nHypothesis Generation We test three potential theoretical explanations for camera activation: Officer demographics, demands of the job, and attitudes about BWCs. Previous research provides little specific guidance regarding a connection between officer demographics and BWC activation. Marvel and Resh (2015) provide some evidence that demographics can shape administrative discretion. However, mixed findings lead the authors to recommend profession-specific tests of their theoretical guidance, under the general prediction that passive and active representation are strengthened in the context of increased discretion (Sowa and Selden 2003). In the context of this study, the only minority demographic variable available is sex, with women representing just 6.8% of the sample in a profession that continues to struggle to achieve anything close to sex parity among its employees (Bishu and Headley 2020). However, there is no clear theoretical or empirical guidance on an expectation that sex would influence BWC activation in a specific direction. Further conflicting the expectations here is, in the BWC activation context, the appropriate discretionary decision might be to not activate, i.e., in the presence of a victim of a sexual or domestic crime (Adams and Mastracci 2017; Ariel et al. 2017). Still, given the persistent academic interest in these correlates in relationship to discretionary measures, we include officer sex within the demographic model with no expectation of a directional effect.\nWithin the policing literature, age, sex, and race all consistently connect to police performance outcomes, including use-of-force (Fridell and Lim 2016; Paoline and Terrill 2007), though there is no consistent expectation that these correlates significantly affect BWC activation. Katz et al. (2015) show a decrease in BWC activations as officers gain experience with the cameras, but Lawrence et al. (2019) find activations increase approximately 25% for every additional fourteen days of BWC experience. Based on the literature, the following non-directional hypothesis is constructed:\n H1: Officer demographics (years of experience, sex, rank, and length of BWC experience) affect BWC activations.\n Young and Ready (2016) support the influence of department policy on BWC activation, as does Ariel et al. (2017), who find that supervisor approval to depart from study protocol, effectively granting broad discretion on whether to activate, led to officers failing to activate the cameras. Agency policies indicate the types of situations in which a BWC recording is expected, which are encountered at varying rates according to an officer\u0026rsquo;s job function and job-related activities. We address the agency-specific activation policy shortly, but in brief, officers who engage in higher levels of specific job behavior \u0026ndash; taking a primary call, using force, and make arrests, for example \u0026ndash; are expected to activate their cameras more often. This prediction is a blending of job role and rule following leading to BWC activation. For our purposes, we test both under the heading of job function with the strong assumption that officers will respond to agency policy (Mummolo 2018). A second hypothesis predicts variation in officers' BWC activations is due to job functions:\n H2: Officers with more primary calls, who make more arrests, and are involved in more use-of-force incidents, activate their BWCs more often than officers with less activity in those areas.\n Finally, the importance of discretion in public service (Maynard-Moody, Musheno, and Musheno 2003) and how beliefs, biases, and perceptions affect discretion, are well established (Epp, Maynard-Moody, and Haider-Markel 2014). Although research on BWC-related attitudes is has grown, regarding activation, somewhat limited guidance is offered. To examine whether officers represent Principled Agents (Dilulio 1994) or as principal-agent problems, an attitudinal hypothesis is tested:\n H3: Officers with negative attitudes towards body-worn cameras activate their cameras less often than officers with positive attitudes.\n Survey and Administrative Data An electronic survey was distributed in Summer 2018, remaining open for 30 days. Of the 461 officers invited to the survey, 188 completed it, for a response rate of 40.1%. Of the 188 respondents, 147 are equipped with a BWC. One of these held a rank higher than lieutenant and was dropped, resulting in a final sample of 146. Detailed descriptive data for the sample is reported below.\nAdministrative data was not expected or included in the original survey design, but was made available many months after completing the survey effort. Following the primary investigators' delivery of a white-paper to the agency with the survey results, the relationship between agency administration and the research team strengthened. While the underlying survey data had already been analyzed for a separate study (Adams and Mastracci 2019a), the opportunity arose to collect matched administrative data, including the dependent variable here, BWC activations. Thus, some of the underlying attitude items have previously been reported in a peer-reviewed study, though the scalar form, identification, intent, and statistical analysis are different. In addition to the dependent variable, administrative data were supplied on use-of-force, arrest, and primary dispatched calls. The administrative data are matched to the same 30-day window of the electronic survey. Respondents did not know the researchers' intent to combine survey data with department-level reporting on activations, use-of-force, or job function, curbing the risk of demand bias and hypothesis guessing.\nSubject Site, Respondents, and Activation Policy The agency was selected as part of a larger study in which the largest corrections agency, sheriff\u0026rsquo;s office, and municipal policing agency (the current case) in the state all simultaneously participated in a large online survey effort of their entire staff. All three agencies were selected as representatives of US law enforcement\u0026rsquo;s three typical modes, and as the largest agencies in their respective modes. In Gerring\u0026rsquo;s (2007) case selection framework, the current case is capturing multiple useful dimensions for an exploratory study: it is 1) extreme as represented by its size, 2) an index case representing the first agency to widely adopt BWCs, and 3) most similar to at least forty-nine other US agencies responsible for policing a capital city.\nReviews of the evidence base for BWCs suggest that agency characteristics might be responsible for uneven findings (Gaub and White 2020; White and Malm 2020). The department is located in a capital city serving a population of more than 200,000 (US Census Bureau 2017). This department was selected for its widespread, long-standing implementation of BWCs, and its willingness to provide detailed data on use-of-force, BWC activation, and other measures of interest. The department equips frontline sworn personnel with BWCs for \u0026ldquo;first responder roles,\u0026rdquo; including patrol, motor and bike officers, SWAT, gang, and accident investigators.\nThe selected agency was the first in its state to invest significantly in BWCs, deploying 250 cameras by October 2014, well in advance of the wave of BWC adoptions nationwide. The BWC Scorecard tracker (www.bwcscorecard.org) finds the agency\u0026rsquo;s BWC policy, 1) is publicly available, 2) strongly limits officer discretion in recording, 3) allows cancellation of recording at the request of the person they are interacting with, but does not require notification of the recording, 4) allows officer review of the footage before completion of a written report, 5) retains footage but does not mandate deletion, 6) prohibits unauthorized copying of the footage, but does not explicitly prohibit tampering or modifying the footage, 7) does not expressly allow for the automatic release of footage to individuals filing complaints, and 8) does not expressly prohibit biometric indexing and searching of footage. The tracker has not been updated since 2017, but the policy tracker accurately reflects the agency\u0026rsquo;s BWC policy at the time of our data collection. The scorecard fails to account for some applicable city and state policies which override perceived absences of policy features. For example, the city has a policy mandating the release of BWC footage related to officer-involved lethal force within two weeks of the incident, and the state has legislative requirements governing the release of public records, including BWC footage.\nFor the purposes of this study, the most important policy feature is that of discretion, and the selected agency has strong constraints on officer discretion in BWC activation, and has strict disciplinary action for failure to activate when required. Department policy requires officers to activate BWCs when they interact with the public during: 1) All enforcement and investigative contacts, 2) Traffic stops, 3) Self-initiated activity in which the officer would typically notify dispatch (i.e., proactive police work), 4) Any contact that becomes adversarial in a situation that would not otherwise require BWC activation, 5) Any use-of-force; 6) Dispatched calls for service, and 7) Execution of a warrant.\nThus, in the presence of a strong policy regarding discretion, activation is predicted to be a function of job functions such as being dispatched as the primary officer on a call. Figure 1 plots the number of primary calls against BWC activations. These raw data reveal a positive relationship between calls and BWC activation.\nFigure 1: BWC Activations and Total Primary Calls by Officer (n=146) Participants are 146 police officers, all of whom are assigned a BWC, in a single police agency located in the western US. On average, participants are majority white (71%) and male (93%), approximately 40 years old, with about 13 years of law enforcement experience. Participants reflect the demographics of police officers nationwide, though with higher educational attainment: 33.9% have bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degrees, while 10.82% have master\u0026rsquo;s degrees or higher. Approximately 10% report less than a year of experience wearing BWCs, while 56% have more than three years of experience wearing BWCs. Descriptive statistics are in Table 1, and variable operationalization is found in the appendix.\nTable 1. Descriptive Statistics for Study Measures    Variable n Mean Std. Dev.

Approximately 25% of the sample had eleven or fewer activations during the study period, and thirteen officers (8.90%) had zero. Because of the highly-skewed distribution in the raw count, a natural log of the raw count plus one (to account for zeroes) is used (x̄=3.42, SD=1.51).\nJennings et al. (2014) suggest veteran officers hold differing views regarding BWCs compared to more junior colleagues, and so years of experience is reported (x̄=13.01, SD=7.32). If it is true that officers with positive attitudes towards BWCs are more likely to use the camera, and those attitudes improve with time (Gaub et al. 2016), then officers with more BWC experience should have more BWC activations. This temporal effect is operationalized with a five-point scale which asks an officer how long they have worn a BWC: (1) less than six months, (2) up to a year (3) up to two years (4) up to three years, and (5) over three years (x̄=4.21, SD=1.10). There may be differences in use-of-force, rank, and job roles between male and female officers (Rabe-Hemp 2017), so we control for sex with a dichotomous indicator for female officers, who comprise 6.85% of the sample. Officer rank is also provided, with 78.77% of participants holding the rank of officer, while those at sergeant comprise 17.12% of the sample.\nJob Function Model Job function measures include use-of-force, which is modeled as a count variable between zero and three. The limited range and high skewness of the use-of-force count align with research establishing any use-of-force as a rare occurrence (Alpert and Dunham 2004). The Use-of-Force measure ranges up to three (x̄=0.32, SD=0.63) and is heavily skewed towards zero, with 75.34% of respondents having no use-of-force incidents during the study period. The count combines use-of-force incidents from across the spectrum, including pepper spray (OC), Taser deployments, physical strikes, and firearm pointing. There were no firearm uses or deadly force incidents by officers during the study period. Total Primary Calls measure how many calls an officer is recorded as the primary, documenting officer, and includes both dispatched and proactive cases (x̄=40.68, SD=38.49). A minority of police calls result in either physical or citation arrest. Due to data limitations, only physical arrests are collected as another measure of job activity (x̄=1.56, SD=2.59). During the study period, arrests range up to seventeen, while 57.53% of respondents had zero custodial arrests. Officers with frontline, patrol, and street-investigation assignments (84.93% of the sample) are expected to activate their BWCs more often than those with more administrative or office-centered assignments, and is modeled with the dichotomous dummy measure Front-Line Assignment.\nAttitude Measures Kyle and White (2017, 79) propose that \u0026ldquo;officer attitudes regarding BWCs may in fact be a multi-dimensional concept.\u0026rdquo; Therefore, data are gathered on three conceptions of officer attitude that could affect BWC activations. Attitude measures are drawn from the Perceived Intensity of Monitoring (PIM) scale (Adams and Mastracci 2019b), and are reported using a seven-point Likert-like scale, strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (7).\nFour measures form the PIM scale\u0026rsquo;s discretion subscale: BWC freedom, BWC decision, BWC manipulate, and BWC modify. These items attempt to measure how \u0026ldquo;officers themselves perceive the impact of BWCs on their discretionary decision making\u0026rdquo; while working (Adams and Mastracci 2019b, 4). Three variables, BWC Fair, BWC Protect, and BWC Wellbeing, form the distribution subscale, and capture how officers perceive BWC footage distribution practices at their department. Are the distribution policies fair? Does the agency protect officers when releasing footage? Does the agency take the officer\u0026rsquo;s wellbeing into account when deciding what to release and how to release it? The final two attitude measures are aimed at capturing how officers perceive BWCs could impact them personally. BWC Embarrass measures an officer\u0026rsquo;s perception that the cameras could capture potentially embarrassing personal information or incidents. BWC Hatred measures whether officers believe that BWC footage could make them the target of public hate or anger. Both the embarrass and hatred measures are illustrated in the incident from which the opening vignette was drawn.\nResults Results of the log-linear regressions for the null model and two comparison models are presented in Table 2. The results of the model comparisons support the importance of agency policy on BWC activations in leveraging the use of the technology, even in the face of some officers' negative personal perceptions and preferences regarding it. Findings confirm and build upon results from previous research on activations (Lawrence et al. 2019; Young and Ready 2016). A post-hoc, observed power analysis was conducted alongside sensitivity and effect size analyses. Those analyses found the study was well-powered, with small to intermediate effect sizes. Readers can find detailed power and sensitivity analyses in the appendix to this study.\nTable 2.

The first model explains about one-sixth of the variance in BWC activation. Sex, and length of time wearing a BWC, are both non-significant. The effect of years of experience is negative and significant. Rank is significant at only the level of lieutenant, and its effect is negative. Officers of command rank such as lieutenant represent a small portion of police officers overall, with only six in this sample.\nSurprisingly, when other factors are held constant, the length of time an officer has worn a BWC is not significantly related to how often they activate the camera, contrasting with previous attitude research suggesting a temporal effect on officer attitudes towards BWCs. While this study does not measure a temporal change in attitude, experience with BWCs is expected to positively influence activations. The impact of experience with BWCs reported here is in the positive direction but is non-significant.\nRobust support is found for H2, which predicts job function covariates will be significantly related to BWC activation. The model explains nearly half of the variance in BWC activation across 146 officers. Regarding the individual predictors, the effect of force count, primary calls, arrests, and line officer condition are all positive and significant. These correlates, derived from the agency\u0026rsquo;s policy on activations, are all in the direction predicted by policy constraints. For example, the policy requires activation in the event of an arrest, and so the more arrests an officer makes, the more activations expected. This relationship holds for all job function model predictors.\nH3 posits that individual officer attitudes regarding BWCs have a significant effect on BWC activations. Minimal support is found for the effect of officers' attitudes towards BWCs, as statistical significance is only observed for one-third of attitudinal correlates, and explaining about one-fifth of activation variance. Regarding the individual predictors, the effect of BWC Modify and BWC Hatred is negative and significant, and the effect of BWC Embarrass is positive and significant. All other attitudinal correlates were non-significant.\nDiscretion is measured using the survey item: \u0026ldquo;Wearing a body camera pressures me to modify certain professional practices I have had in the past.\u0026rdquo; Previous scholars have revealed that negative attitudes about BWCs stem from officer concerns about the suppressive effects of BWCs on their exercise of professional discretion (Gaub et al. 2016; Gaub, Todak, and White 2018; Headley, Guerette, and Shariati 2017; White, Todak, and Gaub 2018). Our results support those findings.\nMinimal correlation was found among most study correlates. Moderate correlation is found among attitudinal factors drawn from the same PIM subscales. All correlations are well below the 0.80 threshold (Berry et al. 1985), and findings were robust to adding or dropping predictor variables with moderate correlation. Post-estimation diagnostics show all models are free from impairing multicollinearity, with generalized mean variance inflation factors (GVIF) below the standard cutoff (Fox and Monette 1992). As a general robustness check, an alternative attitude model was constructed, with individual subscale items mutated into latent constructions of \u0026ldquo;discretion\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;distribution.\u0026rdquo; Neither latent variable was statistically significant, though the overall model results are broadly the same, suggesting the original model construction is more acceptable, as it allows the individual items to attain significance (or not).\nDiscussion This article investigated three explanations of police officer activation of body-worn cameras: Individual demographic characteristics, individual attitudes towards BWCs, and job function indicators. Results indicate that job function explains variation in BWC activation, implying that officers are Principled Agents (Dilulio 1994). This is consistent with the bulk of literature that finds, \u0026ldquo;Officers' behavior is only weakly related, if at all, to their occupational attitudes\u0026rdquo; (Engel and Worden 2003, 156).\nRegardless of an officer\u0026rsquo;s attitudes towards BWCs or their demographic characteristics, our study finds minimal evidence of an impact on how BWCs are used. Results support Dilulio\u0026rsquo;s (1994, 316) conclusion that public service workers are more constrained by agency policy and leadership than motivated by self-interest, because \u0026ldquo;there is more self-sacrifice, and less self-interest, than rational choice theory allows.\u0026rdquo;\nComparing three model specifications indicates that job function correlates provide a better model. First, in both AIC (job function=459.867; attitudes=516.207) and BIC (job function=492.687; attitudes=563.944) for model selection, the job function model is preferred (Burnham and Anderson 2004). Further, gains in the amount of variation explained (over the demographic model) are stark. The job function model gains .320 over the null model with an adjusted R2 of .448, while the attitudes model gains only .085 over the null model with an adjusted R2 of .213. The strong relationship between primary calls, arrests, and use-of-force is visualized in Figure 2, with the addition of a loess-smoothed relationship line between primary calls and activations.\nFigure 2: Scatterplot of BWC Activations by Primary Calls, with Arrests and Force Count When assessing model fit, one further factor relates to number rather than magnitude: Are more officers over- or under-activating BWCs compared to the model predictions? In any OLS regression, the sum of the positive and negative residuals cancels out, but this does not enhance our understanding of whether individual officers are using their camera more or less often than model predictions.\nContrasting the number of observations with positive versus negative y residuals shows that 92 officers (63%) activate their cameras more often than predicted, while 54 (37%) activate less often. This is an important finding and holds for the attitudes model as well (94 officers versus 52). In terms of unexplained variation, nearly two-thirds of officers activate their cameras more often than predicted by their job functions.\nThis result suggests a substantial majority of officers, rather than finding ways not to record, are recording more often than predicted, given the correlates and theory available. This builds upon recent evidence that there is a cohort of officers who have distinct under-activation patters (Martain, Harinam, and Ariel 2020).\nThe top-line finding of this article is that job functions strongly predict BWC activation, explaining nearly half of the variation among officers. This result confirms empirical findings from previous work showing the impact of administrative policy on BWC activations (Young and Ready 2016) and the suspicion from Lum and colleagues (2019, 19) that equivocal empirical results from experiments might arise at least partly from \u0026ldquo;variation in agency policies regarding how the devices should be used.\u0026rdquo; Variation in BWC activation is expected across differing policing contexts because there is variation in the department policies, not due to differences in individual officer perceptions of the technology itself.\nLimitations and Future Research As policies regarding BWCs still evolve, this article\u0026rsquo;s results should be contextualized within its limitations. First, with its cross-sectional design, the study is vulnerable to non-response bias, confounding effects, and item missingness. While the study has a healthy response rate of 49%, it is possible officers who chose not to respond to the survey have a non-random reason for not responding, which might relate to BWC activations and could bias the reported results. Even with a responsive sample, this is a study that relies on a relatively limited one. The size of the sample cuts in two directions, limiting confidence in the effect size estimates while simultaneously increasing the odds of a Type II error. While no statistically significant relationship between some variables is found, this should be considered suggestive but not conclusive.\nRelatedly, while both the job function model and the supported model report adjusted R2 statistics of close to 0.5, a confounding unmeasured variable cannot be discounted from any cross-sectional study, and caution in interpreting the results outside of the study context is warranted. Finally, law enforcement is a challenging population to survey (Nix et al. 2019), and distrust of academia may dampen respondents' willingness to answer personal and sensitive questions. For example, the average missingness for demographic items here was 18.51%. Future police surveys should consider methods to improve overall responsiveness.\nIn line with the research questions motivated by Young and Ready\u0026rsquo;s findings (2016), this article provides empirical evidence that factors outside personal attitudes provide the most explanatory power for understanding BWC activations. However, policy direction necessarily relies on appropriate department policy. The studied department implements a BWC policy with a practical bias towards recording interactions between officers and the public. In the context of BWC studies, the policy would be considered a \u0026ldquo;mandatory activation\u0026rdquo; one, as opposed to \u0026ldquo;discretionary activation\u0026rdquo; (White and Malm 2020).\nThe studied agency has a robust review and compliance scheme, which may influence our findings. During the time between implementing BWCs in 2014 and this study, the department\u0026rsquo;s command staff estimate fewer than five sustained allegations involving an officer failing to activate a BWC when they should have. High compliance in BWC activation suggests officers are responsive to agency policy (Mummolo 2018), and underlines the importance of accountability procedures as a constraint on officer discretion (Walker 2010).\nThe studied agency employs all three types of BWC review identified by White and Malm (2020), such that supervisors can audit BWC compliance for administrative, compliance, and performance review. Thus, generalizing this article\u0026rsquo;s findings to departments with more discretionary policies, significantly higher activation non-compliance, or lax supervisor auditing is not recommended until further research can establish replicability in those settings.\nAgency context and experience should also be weighed. Within our sample, 75% of officers did not use force during the 30-day study period, and over half did not record a physical arrest. These are measures with high variability between agencies, and suggests even more caution and further study before generalizing to other agencies. Finally, as new evidence shows that \u0026ldquo;under-activators\u0026rdquo; may be comprised of specific types of officers (Martain, Harinam, and Ariel 2020), future research should consider using experimental techniques to provide targeted feedback to these officers.\nA third limitation is in the operationalization of the dependent variable. Like many police performance questions (Shane 2019; 2007), the measurement of BWC activation is complex, can support different operationalizations, and lacks research consensus. This challenge across the BWC literature has led to calls for more standardized metrics (White and Malm 2020), and we join that recommendation. It is theoretically possible, albeit technically infeasible, to establish a ratio rather than a count variable to measure BWC activation. In such a design counter-factual, researchers establish a denominator of how often a BWC ought to have been activated. In practice, however, this is a fundamentally implausible goal for research at scale.\nThe first challenge to the reliable construction of such a denominator is the nature of police work itself. Officers work in chaotic, fluid environments. While a policy may control for many contextual decisions\u0026mdash;activate when force is expected to be used, and during arrests, but not in hospitals or when interviewing the victim of sexual assault (Adams and Mastracci 2017)\u0026mdash;no policy can predict all situations all the time. This may partly explain the negative relationship between activations and officer perception regarding the impact of BWCs on professional discretion. However, policies that grant any level of discretion to officers in BWC activation neatly confound researcher intent to measure how often a camera should have been activated. While such a count might be created by a researcher observing a single officer in a single shift, larger-scale quantitative analysis does not allow for establishing a basic definition for such a denominator.\nWe accept that there are alternative identification methods available, though we argue they have at least as many shortcomings as our selected method. For example, one can imagine constructing a rate of activation (activations per ten calls) in order to introduce some control for opportunity, and identifying the rest of the models as already done. In our view, for an exploratory, hypothesis-generating study, this identification strategy leans too heavily on the assumption that it is officers responding as the primary responder to a call (as opposed to a secondary or tertiary officer) driving activation.\nThe empirical data in our sample offer opposing evidence to this, even before modeling decisions. For example, many observations record far more activations than primary calls, and while the median activations per call is only 1.47, ten officers have over ten activations per primary call. This suggests that job role, not mere call opportunity, is more salient, as officers in patrol specialties are expected to have different attitudes and use for BWCs (Gaub, Todak, and White 2018), and are more likely to be responding as non-primary officers to incidents in order to provide their support as specialists.\nFurther, the same motivation for controlling for exposure applies to arrests, or use of force incidents, in that those too provide opportunity for activation. The modeling strategy selected here is not ideal, but appropriate to the study aims of exploring a case with sufficient attributes to allow for hypothesis generation and testing of correlates thought to be salient to BWC activation specifically, and discretion broadly. Future research should consider following recent innovations in BWC research, using metadata to develop more granular datasets capable of confronting the challenges above (Martain, Harinam, and Ariel 2020).\nGiven these challenges, this article adopts a course measure of nuanced performance, and constructs a series of models that attempt to capture the intended benefits of an accurate denominator through inference. The benefits of an accurate denominator should not be forgone, and active work in this area continues at academic and practitioner levels. Here, we demonstrate that through accurate measures of the number of calls, involvement in use-of-force situations, the number of arrests, experience level, and job assignment, one can form adequate proxies for the variables likely to influence how often a BWC ought to have activated. Still, a mix of proxy measures is not the idealized measure itself, and imposes limits on interpreting the findings.\nConclusion This article opened with a vignette of an officer in Spokane, Washington, who activated his BWC and was thereafter exposed to intense media, political, and public scrutiny (Shanks 2020). Left out of those discussions was the question of why? Why would an officer activate his camera and then immediately be caught saying something he knew would attract criticism?This article suggests the officer activated his BWC because he was supposed to. He was arriving to work a protest, and his department requires BWC activation in that job function. As a Principled Agent, he complied with that policy requirement.\nThe results reported here support straightforward reasoning for why officers activate, or do not activate, their BWCs. Neither underlying demographic characteristics nor variation in attitudes towards BWCs adequately explains how often an officer activates their BWC. Instead, officers use BWCs because agency policy requires them to do so while handling calls, making arrests, and using force. When it comes to BWC activations, officers act as principled agents, not principal-agent problems. This article confirms a long research line that finds weak or absent links between officer attitude and behavior. Officers are responsive to department directives (Mummolo 2018), and as we show, variation in BWC activation is most explainable by variation in job function activity.\nWhile there continue to be no easy answers to explain the mixed results from BWC research overall, this article contributes to the literature by providing preliminary evidence that the failure to capture the cameras' intended benefits does not fall solely on the shoulders of individual officers. As noted in other works (Epp, Maynard-Moody, and Haider-Markel 2014; S. Maynard-Moody and Musheno 2012), the impacts of officer discretion are nuanced. While individual officer behavior is better explained by agency policy and legal guidance than by individual attitude and bias, the policies themselves can perpetuate inequity, and the juridical bounds may grant so much latitude that they \u0026ldquo;take on the nature of a farce\u0026rdquo; (Maynard-Moody and Musheno 2012, S18). It is contingent upon the still-developing guidance for best practices related to the deployment of BWCs to provide proper guidance to the officers equipped with them. The evidence presented here suggests that officers will implement such policy as principled agents of their community and agencies.\n \\newpage\nReference Aberbach, Joel D., and Bert A.

Body-worn cameras (BWCs) are a workplace surveillance technology intended to monitor officer behavior in the field, but officers exercise discretion over whether or not to activate their cameras. So, what drives officers to activate BWCs? Combining unique survey and administrative data, three competing explanations of BWC activation are compared in one department: Officer demographics, job function, and attitudes. Job function covariates offer robust predictive power of BWC activation frequency. Demographics do not predict BWC activations except rank, which negatively correlates with activation. Though the bulk of attitudinal measures do not predict BWC activations, negative relationships are noted with how officers perceive BWCs to impact their professional discretion, and their belief that cameras expose officers to public outrage and disapproval.\n**Keywords**: *Administrative Discretion; Policing; Body-Worn Cameras*","tags":[],"title":"High-Stakes Administrative Discretion: What Drives Body-Worn Camera Activations?","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":["website","R"],"content":"\r\rThis is a post to breadcrumb the migration of the previous website.

This is a free book, available here . If you prefer a hardcopy, you can order one from a number of sources as well, including at Amazon.\nAs you read through the assigned chapters, the authors have included a variety of practical exercises to introduce you to R, with a focus on the “tidyverse,” a collection of statistical packages that make exploring, analyzing, visualizing, and communicating data a more enjoyable, replicable, and easy-to-learn process. Some of these exercises will be assigned, but we also highly recommend you complete the exercises as you read through the book! These exercises are quite short, and usually have the coded answers built right into the book, so you can copy/paste right into RStudio and see the solution.\nData Visualization Exercises\rAlways remember to load your tidyverse library!\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r## -- Attaching packages --------------------------------------- tidyverse 1.3.0 --\r## v ggplot2 3.3.2 v purrr 0.3.4\r## v tibble 3.0.4 v dplyr 1.0.2\r## v tidyr 1.1.2 v stringr 1.4.0\r## v readr 1.4.0 v forcats 0.5.0\r## -- Conflicts ------------------------------------------ tidyverse_conflicts() --\r## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\r## x dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag()\r\rFirst steps\rExercise 3.2.1\rRun ggplot(data = mpg) what do you see?\n\rggplot(data = mpg)\rThis code creates an empty plot.

Why is the plot not useful?\n\rThe resulting scatterplot has only a few points.\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = class, y = drv)) +\rgeom_point()\rA scatter plot is not a useful display of these variables since both drv and class are categorical variables. Since categorical variables typically take a small number of values, there are a limited number of unique combinations of (x, y) values that can be displayed. In this data, drv takes 3 values and class takes 7 values, meaning that there are only 21 values that could be plotted on a scatterplot of drv vs. class. In this data, there 12 values of (drv, class) are observed.\ncount(mpg, drv, class)\r## # A tibble: 12 x 3\r## drv class n\r## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt;\r## 1 4 compact 12\r## 2 4 midsize 3\r## 3 4 pickup 33\r## 4 4 subcompact 4\r## 5 4 suv 51\r## 6 f compact 35\r## 7 f midsize 38\r## 8 f minivan 11\r## 9 f subcompact 22\r## 10 r 2seater 5\r## 11 r subcompact 9\r## 12 r suv 11\rA simple scatter plot does not show how many observations there are for each (x, y) value. As such, scatterplots work best for plotting a continuous x and a continuous y variable, and when all (x, y) values are unique.\nWarning: The following code uses functions introduced in a later section. Come back to this after reading section 7.5.2, which introduces methods for plotting two categorical variables. The first is geom_count() which is similar to a scatterplot but uses the size of the points to show the number of observations at an (x, y) point.\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = class, y = drv)) +\rgeom_count()\rThe second is geom_tile() which uses a color scale to show the number of observations with each (x, y) value.\nmpg %\u0026gt;%\rcount(class, drv) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(x = class, y = drv)) +\rgeom_tile(mapping = aes(fill = n))\rIn the previous plot, there are many missing tiles. These missing tiles represent unobserved combinations of class and drv values. These missing values are not unknown, but represent values of (class, drv) where n = 0. The complete() function in the tidyr package adds new rows to a data frame for missing combinations of columns. The following code adds rows for missing combinations of class and drv and uses the fill argument to set n = 0 for those new rows.\nmpg %\u0026gt;%\rcount(class, drv) %\u0026gt;%\rcomplete(class, drv, fill = list(n = 0)) %\u0026gt;%\rggplot(aes(x = class, y = drv)) +\rgeom_tile(mapping = aes(fill = n))\r\r\r\r3.3 Aesthetic mappings\rExercise 3.3.1\rWhat’s gone wrong with this code? Why are the points not blue?\nggplot(data = mpg) +\rgeom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = \u0026quot;blue\u0026quot;))\r\rThe argumentcolour = \"blue\" is included within the mapping argument, and as such, it is treated as an aesthetic, which is a mapping between a variable and a value. In the expression, colour = \"blue\", \"blue\" is interpreted as a categorical variable which only takes a single value \"blue\". If this is confusing, consider how colour = 1:234 and colour = 1 are interpreted by aes().\nThe following code does produces the expected result.\nggplot(data = mpg) +\rgeom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), colour = \u0026quot;blue\u0026quot;)\r\r\rExercise 3.3.2\rWhich variables in mpg are categorical?

This largely corresponds to the heuristics ggplot() uses for will interpreting variables as discrete or continuous.\nHowever, this definition of continuous vs. categorical misses several important cases. Of the numeric variables, year and cyl (cylinders) clearly take on discrete values. The variables cty and hwy are stored as integers (int) so they only take on a discrete values. Even though displ has In some sense, due to measurement and computational constraints all numeric variables are discrete (). But unlike the categorical variables, it is possible to add and subtract these numeric variables in a meaningful way. The typology of levels of measurement is one such typology of data types.\nIn this case the R data types largely encode the semantics of the variables; e.g. integer variables are stored as integers, categorical variables with no order are stored as character vectors and so on. However, that is not always the case. Instead, the data could have stored the categorical class variable as an integer with values 1–7, where the documentation would note that 1 = “compact”, 2 = “midsize”, and so on.1 Even though this integer vector could be added, multiplied, subtracted, and divided, those operations would be meaningless.\nFundamentally, categorizing variables as “discrete”, “continuous”, “ordinal”, “nominal”, “categorical”, etc. is about specifying what operations can be performed on the variables. Discrete variables support counting and calculating the mode. Variables with an ordering support sorting and calculating quantiles. Variables that have an interval scale support addition and subtraction and operations such as taking the mean that rely on these primitives. In this way, the types of data or variables types is an information class system, something that is beyond the scope of R4DS but discussed in Advanced R.\n\r\rExercise 3.3.3\rMap a continuous variable to color, size, and shape. How do these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. continuous variables?\n\rThe variable cty, city highway miles per gallon, is a continuous variable.\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = cty)) +\rgeom_point()\rInstead of using discrete colors, the continuous variable uses a scale that varies from a light to dark blue color.\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = cty)) +\rgeom_point()\rWhen mapped to size, the sizes of the points vary continuously as a function of their size.\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = cty)) +\rgeom_point()\r## Error: A continuous variable can not be mapped to shape\rWhen a continuous value is mapped to shape, it gives an error. Though we could split a continuous variable into discrete categories and use a shape aesthetic, this would conceptually not make sense. A numeric variable has an order, but shapes do not. It is clear that smaller points correspond to smaller values, or once the color scale is given, which colors correspond to larger or smaller values. But it is not clear whether a square is greater or less than a circle.\n\r\rExercise 3.3.4\rWhat happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics?\n\rggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = hwy, size = displ)) +\rgeom_point()\rIn the above plot, hwy is mapped to both location on the y-axis and color, and displ is mapped to both location on the x-axis and size. The code works and produces a plot, even if it is a bad one. Mapping a single variable to multiple aesthetics is redundant. Because it is redundant information, in most cases avoid mapping a single variable to multiple aesthetics.\n\r\rExercise 3.3.5\rWhat does the stroke aesthetic do? What shapes does it work with? (Hint: use ?geom_point)\n\rStroke changes the size of the border for shapes (21-25). These are filled shapes in which the color and size of the border can differ from that of the filled interior of the shape.\nFor example\nggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) +\rgeom_point(shape = 21, colour = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, fill = \u0026quot;white\u0026quot;, size = 5, stroke = 5)\r\r\rExercise 3.3.6\rWhat happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable name, like aes(colour = displ \u0026lt; 5)?\n\rggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = displ \u0026lt; 5)) +\rgeom_point()\rAesthetics can also be mapped to expressions like displ \u0026lt; 5. The ggplot() function behaves as if a temporary variable was added to the data with values equal to the result of the expression. In this case, the result of displ \u0026lt; 5 is a logical variable which takes values of TRUE or FALSE.\nThis also explains why, in Exercise 3.3.1, the expression colour = \"blue\" created a categorical variable with only one category: “blue”.\n\r\rFacets\rExercise 3.5.1\rWhat happens if you facet on a continuous variable?\n\rLet’s see.\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +\rgeom_point() +\rfacet_grid(. ~ cty)\rThe continuous variable is converted to a categorical variable, and the plot contains a facet for each distinct value.\n\r\rExercise 3.5.2\rWhat do the empty cells in plot with facet_grid(drv ~ cyl) mean? How do they relate to this plot?\nggplot(data = mpg) +\rgeom_point(mapping = aes(x = drv, y = cyl))\r\rggplot(data = mpg) +\rgeom_point(mapping = aes(x = hwy, y = cty)) +\rfacet_grid(drv ~ cyl)\rThe empty cells (facets) in this plot are combinations of drv and cyl that have no observations. These are the same locations in the scatter plot of drv and cyl that have no points.\nggplot(data = mpg) +\rgeom_point(mapping = aes(x = drv, y = cyl))\r\r\rExercise 3.5.3\rWhat plots does the following code make? What does . do?\n\rThe symbol . ignores that dimension when faceting. For example, drv ~ . facet by values of drv on the y-axis.\nggplot(data = mpg) +\rgeom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +\rfacet_grid(drv ~ .)\rWhile, . ~ cyl will facet by values of cyl on the x-axis.\nggplot(data = mpg) +\rgeom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +\rfacet_grid(. ~ cyl)\r\r\rExercise 3.5.4\rTake the first faceted plot in this section:\nggplot(data = mpg) +\rgeom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +\rfacet_wrap(~class, nrow = 2)\rWhat are the advantages to using faceting instead of the colour aesthetic? What are the disadvantages? How might the balance change if you had a larger dataset?\n\rIn the following plot the class variable is mapped to color.\nggplot(data = mpg) +\rgeom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))\rAdvantages of encoding class with facets instead of color include the ability to encode more distinct categories. For me, it is difficult to distinguish between the colors of \"midsize\" and \"minivan\".\nGiven human visual perception, the max number of colors to use when encoding unordered categorical (qualitative) data is nine, and in practice, often much less than that. Displaying observations from different categories on different scales makes it difficult to directly compare values of observations across categories. However, it can make it easier to compare the shape of the relationship between the x and y variables across categories.\nDisadvantages of encoding the class variable with facets instead of the color aesthetic include the difficulty of comparing the values of observations between categories since the observations for each category are on different plots. Using the same x- and y-scales for all facets makes it easier to compare values of observations across categories, but it is still more difficult than if they had been displayed on the same plot. Since encoding class within color also places all points on the same plot, it visualizes the unconditional relationship between the x and y variables; with facets, the unconditional relationship is no longer visualized since the points are spread across multiple plots.\nThe benefit of encoding a variable with facetting over encoding it with color increase in both the number of points and the number of categories. With a large number of points, there is often overlap. It is difficult to handle overlapping points with different colors color. Jittering will still work with color. But jittering will only work well if there are few points and the classes do not overlap much, otherwise, the colors of areas will no longer be distinct, and it will be hard to pick out the patterns of different categories visually. Transparency (alpha) does not work well with colors since the mixing of overlapping transparent colors will no longer represent the colors of the categories. Binning methods already use color to encode the density of points in the bin, so color cannot be used to encode categories.\nAs the number of categories increases, the difference between colors decreases, to the point that the color of categories will no longer be visually distinct.\n\r\rExercise 3.5.5\rRead ?facet_wrap. What does nrow do? What does ncol do? What other options control the layout of the individual panels? Why doesn’t facet_grid() have nrow and ncol variables?\n\rThe arguments nrow (ncol) determines the number of rows (columns) to use when laying out the facets. It is necessary since facet_wrap() only facets on one variable.\nThe nrow and ncol arguments are unnecessary for facet_grid() since the number of unique values of the variables specified in the function determines the number of rows and columns.\n\r\rExercise 3.5.6\rWhen using facet_grid() you should usually put the variable with more unique levels in the columns. Why?\n\rThere will be more space for columns if the plot is laid out horizontally (landscape).\n\r\r\rGeometric objects\rExercise 3.6.1\rWhat geom would you use to draw a line chart? A boxplot?

Why do you think I used it earlier in the chapter?\n\rThe theme option show.legend = FALSE hides the legend box.\nConsider this example earlier in the chapter.\nggplot(data = mpg) +\rgeom_smooth(\rmapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = drv),\rshow.legend = FALSE\r)\r## `geom_smooth()` using method = \u0026#39;loess\u0026#39; and formula \u0026#39;y ~ x\u0026#39;\rIn that plot, there is no legend. Removing the show.legend argument or setting show.legend = TRUE will result in the plot having a legend displaying the mapping between colors and drv.\nggplot(data = mpg) +\rgeom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = drv))\r## `geom_smooth()` using method = \u0026#39;loess\u0026#39; and formula \u0026#39;y ~ x\u0026#39;\rIn the chapter, the legend is suppressed because with three plots, adding a legend to only the last plot would make the sizes of plots different. Different sized plots would make it more difficult to see how arguments change the appearance of the plots. The purpose of those plots is to show the difference between no groups, using a group aesthetic, and using a color aesthetic, which creates implicit groups. In that example, the legend isn’t necessary since looking up the values associated with each color isn’t necessary to make that point.\n\r\rExercise 3.6.4\rWhat does the se argument to geom_smooth() do?\n\rIt adds standard error bands to the lines.\nggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = drv)) +\rgeom_point() +\rgeom_smooth(se = TRUE)\r## `geom_smooth()` using method = \u0026#39;loess\u0026#39; and formula \u0026#39;y ~ x\u0026#39;\rBy default se = TRUE:\nggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = drv)) +\rgeom_point() +\rgeom_smooth()\r## `geom_smooth()` using method = \u0026#39;loess\u0026#39; and formula \u0026#39;y ~ x\u0026#39;\r\r\rExercise 3.6.5\rWill these two graphs look different?

How could you rewrite the previous plot to use that geom function instead of the stat function?\n\rThe “previous plot” referred to in the question is the following.\nggplot(data = diamonds) +\rstat_summary(\rmapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth),\rfun.min = min,\rfun.max = max,\rfun = median\r)\rThe arguments fun.ymin, fun.ymax, and fun.y have been deprecated and replaced with fun.min, fun.max, and fun in ggplot2 v 3.3.0.\nThe default geom for stat_summary() is geom_pointrange(). The default stat for geom_pointrange() is identity() but we can add the argument stat = \"summary\" to use stat_summary() instead of stat_identity().\nggplot(data = diamonds) +\rgeom_pointrange(\rmapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth),\rstat = \u0026quot;summary\u0026quot;\r)\r## No summary function supplied, defaulting to `mean_se()`\rThe resulting message says that stat_summary() uses the mean and sd to calculate the middle point and endpoints of the line. However, in the original plot the min and max values were used for the endpoints. To recreate the original plot we need to specify values for fun.min, fun.max, and fun.\nggplot(data = diamonds) +\rgeom_pointrange(\rmapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth),\rstat = \u0026quot;summary\u0026quot;,\rfun.min = min,\rfun.max = max,\rfun = median\r)\r\r\rExercise 3.7.2\rWhat does geom_col() do? How is it different to geom_bar()?\n\rThe geom_col() function has different default stat than geom_bar(). The default stat of geom_col() is stat_identity(), which leaves the data as is. The geom_col() function expects that the data contains x values and y values which represent the bar height.\nThe default stat of geom_bar() is stat_count(). The geom_bar() function only expects an x variable. The stat, stat_count(), preprocesses input data by counting the number of observations for each value of x. The y aesthetic uses the values of these counts.\n\r\rExercise 3.7.3\rMost geoms and stats come in pairs that are almost always used in concert. Read through the documentation and make a list of all the pairs.

What parameters control its behavior?\n\rThe function stat_smooth() calculates the following variables:\n\ry: predicted value\rymin: lower value of the confidence interval\rymax: upper value of the confidence interval\rse: standard error\r\rThe “Computed Variables” section of the stat_smooth() documentation contains these variables.\nThe parameters that control the behavior of stat_smooth() include:\n\rmethod: This is the method used to compute the smoothing line. If NULL, a default method is used based on the sample size: stats::loess() when there are less than 1,000 observations in a group, and mgcv::gam() with formula = y ~ s(x, bs = \"CS) otherwise. Alternatively, the user can provide a character vector with a function name, e.g. \"lm\", \"loess\", or a function, e.g. MASS::rlm.\n\rformula: When providing a custom method argument, the formula to use. The default is y ~ x. For example, to use the line implied by lm(y ~ x + I(x ^ 2) + I(x ^ 3)), use method = \"lm\" or method = lm and formula = y ~ x + I(x ^ 2) + I(x ^ 3).\n\rmethod.arg(): Arguments other than than the formula, which is already specified in the formula argument, to pass to the function inmethod`.\n\rse: If TRUE, display standard error bands, if FALSE only display the line.\n\rna.rm: If FALSE, missing values are removed with a warning, if TRUE the are silently removed. The default is FALSE in order to make debugging easier. If missing values are known to be in the data, then can be ignored, but if missing values are not anticipated this warning can help catch errors.\n\r\rTODO: Plots with examples illustrating the uses of these arguments.\n\r\rExercise 3.7.5\rIn our proportion bar chart, we need to set group = 1 Why? In other words, what is the problem with these two graphs?\n\rIf group = 1 is not included, then all the bars in the plot will have the same height, a height of 1. The function geom_bar() assumes that the groups are equal to the x values since the stat computes the counts within the group.\nggplot(data = diamonds) +\rgeom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = ..prop..))\rThe problem with these two plots is that the proportions are calculated within the groups.\nggplot(data = diamonds) +\rgeom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = ..prop..))\rggplot(data = diamonds) +\rgeom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = color, y = ..prop..))\rThe following code will produce the intended stacked bar charts for the case with no fill aesthetic.\nggplot(data = diamonds) +\rgeom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = ..prop.., group = 1))\rWith the fill aesthetic, the heights of the bars need to be normalized.\nggplot(data = diamonds) + geom_bar(aes(x = cut, y = ..count.. / sum(..count..), fill = color))\r\r\r\rPosition adjustments\rExercise 3.8.1\rWhat is the problem with this plot? How could you improve it?\nggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +\rgeom_point()\r\rThere is overplotting because there are multiple observations for each combination of cty and hwy values.\nI would improve the plot by using a jitter position adjustment to decrease overplotting.\nggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +\rgeom_point(position = \u0026quot;jitter\u0026quot;)\rThe relationship between cty and hwy is clear even without jittering the points but jittering shows the locations where there are more observations.\n\r\rExercise 3.8.2\rWhat parameters to geom_jitter() control the amount of jittering?\n\rFrom the geom_jitter() documentation, there are two arguments to jitter:\n\rwidth controls the amount of horizontal displacement, and\rheight controls the amount of vertical displacement.\r\rThe defaults values of width and height will introduce noise in both directions. Here is what the plot looks like with the default values of height and width.\nggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +\rgeom_point(position = position_jitter())\rHowever, we can change these parameters. Here are few a examples to understand how these parameters affect the amount of jittering. Whenwidth = 0 there is no horizontal jitter.\nggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +\rgeom_jitter(width = 0)\rWhen width = 20, there is too much horizontal jitter.\nggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +\rgeom_jitter(width = 20)\rWhen height = 0, there is no vertical jitter.\nggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +\rgeom_jitter(height = 0)\rWhen height = 15, there is too much vertical jitter.\nggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +\rgeom_jitter(height = 15)\rWhen width = 0 and height = 0, there is neither horizontal or vertical jitter, and the plot produced is identical to the one produced with geom_point().\nggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +\rgeom_jitter(height = 0, width = 0)\rNote that the height and width arguments are in the units of the data. Thus height = 1 (width = 1) corresponds to different relative amounts of jittering depending on the scale of the y (x) variable. The default values of height and width are defined to be 80% of the resolution() of the data, which is the smallest non-zero distance between adjacent values of a variable. When x and y are discrete variables, their resolutions are both equal to 1, and height = 0.4 and width = 0.4 since the jitter moves points in both positive and negative directions.\nThe default values of height and width in geom_jitter() are non-zero, so unless both height and width are explicitly set set 0, there will be some jitter.\nggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +\rgeom_jitter()\r\r\rExercise 3.8.3\rCompare and contrast geom_jitter() with geom_count().\n\rThe geom geom_jitter() adds random variation to the locations points of the graph. In other words, it “jitters” the locations of points slightly. This method reduces overplotting since two points with the same location are unlikely to have the same random variation.\nggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +\rgeom_jitter()\rHowever, the reduction in overlapping comes at the cost of slightly changing the x and y values of the points.\nThe geom geom_count() sizes the points relative to the number of observations. Combinations of (x, y) values with more observations will be larger than those with fewer observations.\nggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +\rgeom_count()\rThe geom_count() geom does not change x and y coordinates of the points. However, if the points are close together and counts are large, the size of some points can itself create overplotting. For example, in the following example, a third variable mapped to color is added to the plot. In this case, geom_count() is less readable than geom_jitter() when adding a third variable as a color aesthetic.\nggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) +\rgeom_jitter()\rggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) +\rgeom_count()\rCombining geom_count() with jitter, which is specified with the position argument to geom_count() rather than its own geom, helps overplotting a little.\nggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy, color = class)) +\rgeom_count(position = \u0026quot;jitter\u0026quot;)\rBut as this example shows, unfortunately, there is no universal solution to overplotting. The costs and benefits of different approaches will depend on the structure of the data and the goal of the data scientist.\n\r\rExercise 3.8.4\rWhat’s the default position adjustment for geom_boxplot()? Create a visualization of the mpg dataset that demonstrates it.\n\rThe default position for geom_boxplot() is \"dodge2\", which is a shortcut for position_dodge2. This position adjustment does not change the vertical position of a geom but moves the geom horizontally to avoid overlapping other geoms. See the documentation for position_dodge2() for additional discussion on how it works.\nWhen we add colour = class to the box plot, the different levels of the drv variable are placed side by side, i.e., dodged.\nggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = drv, y = hwy, colour = class)) +\rgeom_boxplot()\rIf position_identity() is used the boxplots overlap.\nggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = drv, y = hwy, colour = class)) +\rgeom_boxplot(position = \u0026quot;identity\u0026quot;)\r\r\r\rCoordinate systems\rExercise 3.9.1\rTurn a stacked bar chart into a pie chart using coord_polar().\n\rA pie chart is a stacked bar chart with the addition of polar coordinates. Take this stacked bar chart with a single category.\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = factor(1), fill = drv)) +\rgeom_bar()\rNow add coord_polar(theta=\"y\") to create pie chart.\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = factor(1), fill = drv)) +\rgeom_bar(width = 1) +\rcoord_polar(theta = \u0026quot;y\u0026quot;)\rThe argument theta = \"y\" maps y to the angle of each section. If coord_polar() is specified without theta = \"y\", then the resulting plot is called a bulls-eye chart.\nggplot(mpg, aes(x = factor(1), fill = drv)) +\rgeom_bar(width = 1) +\rcoord_polar()\r\r\rExercise 3.9.2\rWhat does labs() do? Read the documentation.\n\rThe labs function adds axis titles, plot titles, and a caption to the plot.\nggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy)) +\rgeom_boxplot() +\rcoord_flip() +\rlabs(y = \u0026quot;Highway MPG\u0026quot;,\rx = \u0026quot;Class\u0026quot;,\rtitle = \u0026quot;Highway MPG by car class\u0026quot;,\rsubtitle = \u0026quot;1999-2008\u0026quot;,\rcaption = \u0026quot;Source: http://fueleconomy.gov\u0026quot;)\rThe arguments to labs() are optional, so you can add as many or as few of these as are needed.\nggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy)) +\rgeom_boxplot() +\rcoord_flip() +\rlabs(y = \u0026quot;Highway MPG\u0026quot;,\rx = \u0026quot;Year\u0026quot;,\rtitle = \u0026quot;Highway MPG by car class\u0026quot;)\rThe labs() function is not the only function that adds titles to plots. The xlab(), ylab(), and x- and y-scale functions can add axis titles. The ggtitle() function adds plot titles.\n\r\rExercise 3.9.3\rWhat’s the difference between coord_quickmap() and coord_map()?\n\rThe coord_map() function uses map projections to project the three-dimensional Earth onto a two-dimensional plane. By default, coord_map() uses the Mercator projection. This projection is applied to all the geoms in the plot. The coord_quickmap() function uses an approximate but faster map projection. This approximation ignores the curvature of Earth and adjusts the map for the latitude/longitude ratio. The coord_quickmap() project is faster than coord_map() both because the projection is computationally easier, and unlike coord_map(), the coordinates of the individual geoms do not need to be transformed.\nSee the coord_map() documentation for more information on these functions and some examples.\n\r\rExercise 3.9.4\rWhat does the plot below tell you about the relationship between city and highway mpg? Why is coord_fixed() important? What does geom_abline() do?\n\rThe function coord_fixed() ensures that the line produced by geom_abline() is at a 45-degree angle. A 45-degree line makes it easy to compare the highway and city mileage to the case in which city and highway MPG were equal.\np \u0026lt;- ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +\rgeom_point() +\rgeom_abline()\rp + coord_fixed()\rIf we didn’t include coord_fixed(), then the line would no longer have an angle of 45 degrees.\np\rOn average, humans are best able to perceive differences in angles relative to 45 degrees. See @Cleveland1993, @Cleveland1994,@Cleveland1993a, @ClevelandMcGillMcGill1988, @HeerAgrawala2006 for discussion on how the aspect ratio of a plot affects perception of the values it encodes, evidence that 45-degrees is generally the optimal aspect ratio, and methods to calculate the optimal aspect ratio of a plot. The function ggthemes::bank_slopes() will calculate the optimal aspect ratio to bank slopes to 45-degrees.\n\r\r\r\r\rInternally, this is what the factor class, which is covered in Chapter 15, does.↩︎\n\r\r\r","date":1609113600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609190558,"objectID":"01747ced7f1f2d91edf1c367da81002e","permalink":"https://ianadamsresearch.com/courses/pubpl-6002/chapter-3/","publishdate":"2020-12-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/pubpl-6002/chapter-3/","section":"courses","summary":"One of the wonderful features of the R statistical universe is the number of free, high-quality instructional materials available.

However, you must do all the Git(Hub) set up [described elsewhere][https://happygitwithr.com/] before you can take advantage of this.    If you have a pre-existing installation of R and/or RStudio, we highly recommend that you reinstall both and get as current as possible. It can be considerably harder to run old software than new.\n  If you upgrade R, you will need to update any packages you have installed. The command below should get you started, though you may need to specify more arguments if, e.g., you have been using a non-default library for your packages.\nupdate.packages(ask = FALSE, checkBuilt = TRUE)\r Note: this will only look for updates on CRAN.

Written by Zach Beauchamp, the article purports to have the inside track on an “ideology of American policing,” one that “justifies racist violence” in the minds of police officers. Startling stuff.\nBefore you hear from me, go check out the article. First though, ask yourself: How many active police officers do you think the author spoke with, based on the headline?\nI initially looked forward to reading the article. I am a former officer, and now a scholar who devotes a great deal of time thinking about and researching police attitudes and beliefs. From what officers’ own words can tell us about their propensity to “de-police” to how officers perceive the “intensity” of monitoring from body-worn cameras, I approach officers as human beings with something to say, and with something worth hearing.\nMy initial hopes for the article were not fulfilled. The article begins with promises of a “deep dive” but ends up misjudging the depth of the pool. It soon became clear where the author went wrong: He forgot to listen to cops.\rWriting an article that promises insight into a group of human beings, but then not interviewing one person who is from that group, is almost guaranteed to result in a failure to communicate effectively about that group.\nBut don’t take my word for it, here’s how Beauchamp reports he conducted his research:\nDinkheller \u0026amp; Administrative Heat\rOne of the critical linchpins of Beauchamp’s case is that this “ideology of American policing” starts in the academy with a showing of the “Dinkheller” video. Being familiar with that video, and somewhat knowledgeable about how it can be framed for police recruits, Beauchamp’s reductionist vision of it was quite startling.\nI first encountered the Dinkheller video at the academy as a young recruit. The purpose as I remember it was in the context of how administrative “heat” can cause officers to hesitate when they absolutely should not. No one can perfectly attest to what caused Dinkheller to hesitate taking action even in the face of the most violent and predictable outcomes. Five separate law enforcement officers confirmed one version of events, centered on the idea that Dinkheller was distressed about his trouble with the Sheriff over a previous demeanor complaint on a traffic stop. Here is some support for that idea, from CNN’s coverage of the incident.\n\r“In the late ’90s, some rank-and-file deputies believed [Sheriff Webb] wouldn’t stand by them in a crisis. This was partly due to an incident that involved Kyle Dinkheller just a few months before he died.\rKyle was on his way to a crash scene with his lights flashing when he came upon a vehicle whose driver wouldn’t move aside. Because state law requires civilians to yield in those situations, Kyle spoke harshly to the man, who turned out to be a good friend of the sheriff. The man complained to Webb, who told Kyle to write a letter of apology. Kyle initially refused to write the letter. He told fellow deputies that the sheriff ordered him to write it or face severe consequences.\rKyle wrote the letter. His colleagues say the sheriff made him re-write it and deliver it by hand. The incident weighed on him. When he saw Deputy Skip Lowery at the gas pumps, Kyle would say things like,”Y’all write any letters of apology today?\" Two days before he died, in a friendly visit to the home of Special Agent Alan Watson of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, Kyle mentioned the apology. His colleagues are convinced it was somewhere in the back of his mind during his final traffic stop. He knew he was being watched, and he’d learned that being right was not always enough.\"\n\r\rExperts and Practitioners\rWhy isn’t this theme reflected in the Vox article? What’s missing from Beauchamp’s reporting? Well…officers. Though the article describes “a deep dive into the motivations and beliefs of police,” a less flashy but more honest appraisal of the approach would be: a collection of academic opinions without the mess of dealing with the views of practitioners.\nTo his credit, Beauchamp calls on the words of highly respected academics, including Eugene Paoline, who, along with William Terrill, authored “Listen to Me! Police Officers Views of Appropriate Use of Force,” a compelling argument for listening to the voices of actual, working law enforcement officers. The article also includes thoughts from Peter Moskos, a former officer, current professor at Jon Jay College of Criminal Justice, and author of the exceptional Cop in the Hood (really, you should read it).\nSo what’s the complaint then? Didn’t Beauchamp do what he set out to do? He interviewed experts and former police. Doesn’t that get you “inside the ideology of American policing”? No, it doesn’t. Despite the excellent academic contributions, Beauchamp misses the mark fairly widely by not listening to officers who are actively serving their communities. It is clear what Beauchamp missed: the gap between expert opinion, and officers’ perceptions (if you bother to ask them directly). While I’m writing in response to a journalist, this is also a reminder to myself, and others who study policing - be wary of letting our own voices carry louder than those we report on and research. All the interesting variation is in the voices and experiences of those we study; our overlays of theory and interpretation strip out that variation.\n\rBeauchamp’s Claim\rBeauchamp spends ample time unpacking expert and academic views on the Dinkheller video. Like Professor Moskos correctly says, this is a video that most every officer knows, but not many outside policing or the study of it do. Warning – it’s not a pleasant video (contains disturbing audio and video of an officer being murdered): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mssNOhv1UMc. If the video is too much (and it is for me), you can read about the incident here.\nBeauchamp makes this claim about the purpose of showing the Dinkheller video to police recruits:\nFrom Beauchamp’s reporting, however, all we know is his interpretation, based on a handful of experts and former officers, but not a single, actual, bonafide officer. Is that what they think the purpose of the video is? The easiest way to find out is to ask. So I did.\n\rOfficers’ Views\rI called six current officers whom I know personally. They range from very close friends who would raise my children if needed, to professional contacts in other parts of the country. I promised them I wouldn’t use names, but just their rank, approximate years on the job, and current assignment. Here’s what they said about the Dinkheller video. I asked them if they remembered the video, and if so, what was the purpose of the video. This is obviously not a random sample.\nThese are their immediate, off-the-cuff responses that I typed directly into the document as we spoke:\nOfficer, ~20 years, narcotics officer: That video was about doing what you have to do. It was a constable, right? He was jammed up by his chief on something else, like a use-of-force. Then when it came time, he hesitated. The purpose I guess was to teach us not to let an administrator get us killed.\n\rOfficer, \u0026lt; 3 years, patrol officer: I actually don’t remember that video.\n\rOfficer, ~15 years, traffic enforcement: That was about not letting a dude do what he did. You don’t let a guy back into the car after all that. It ain’t gonna end well, ever.\n\rLieutenant, ~15 years, major crimes: Oh yeah, I remember it. It was about how you can’t let someone disobey your lawful commands over and over. If you do, there’s always going to be a bad outcome. Unfortunately for that officer, the outcome was death. Young officers need to know what to look out for, and take action when it’s necessary.\n\rMajor, ~25 years, training academy director: I don’t know if we still use that video, I’d have to check with my trainers to see. These days we introduce the recruits to those types of videos much later. That video is hard for even you and I to watch. When I did use that video in the past, it was for the flags. What flags can we point to where the officer could have made a different decision? That man struck the officer, and then he allowed him to get back into the truck and retrieve a rifle. That should not have happened. I want my recruits to have the confidence to stop him from getting back into the vehicle.\n\rOfficer, ~20 years, patrol and use-of-force trainer: Man, the Dinkheller video was horrific. The indicators of non-compliance are all there. You’ll see odd behaviors in the extreme. Most traffic stops are extremely predictable. When we see things outside of the norm, that’s when we need to pay attention. It would be foolish not to show officers what the out-of-the-ordinary looks like. The Dinkheller video is not an example of the normal traffic stop, it’s the video that shows what’s not normal, what an officer needs to pay attention to. When you see the indicators, the hands in the pockets, the strange behavior, the noncompliance, you need to immediately hop on that. When you disregard those, when you hesitate, when you ignore the physiological effects like the voice stress, the repetitive commands – that tells you Dinkheller has lost control. As a trainer I need to put people into stressful scenarios. For me as an officer and a trainer, I need to recognize “this is not good, this is waaaay outside the bounds of good, I need to do something.” Teaching recruits how to deal with fear is imperative. Clearly recognizing the warning signs is part of that. That only comes from training and experience. There’s no way around that.\n\r\r\rThemes from Police\rSo, what do police actually believe about the Dinkheller video? We have four themes:\nNot exposed to the video, or video not in use. This is a particular problem for Beauchamp’s thesis that the Dinkheller video is forming an ideology that “justifies racist violence.”\n\rThe purpose of the video is to teach recruits the “flags” that might mean their lives are in danger. Refusing to remove his hands from his pockets [0:22], dancing around yelling “Fuck you Goddamnit, here I am, shoot my fucking ass!” [0:29], shouting “Fucking do it man!” [0:46], physically attacking the officer [1:00], getting back into the vehicle [1:10], retrieving an M1 rifle from the truck [1:20], aiming the rifle at the officer [1:20 – 1:55], and finally firing at the officer beginning at [1:56].\n\rThe purpose of the video was to reinforce the danger of not enforcing an officer’s legal commands. Repeated indifference to an officer’s commands is a danger signal that officers should pay attention to. Act when your eyes are telling you there is a problem.\n\rThe purpose of the video was to instill in officers that they should not let previous administrative burdens become a death sentence. It is fascinating that multiple officers, from different parts of the country, remember this theme from their training days. The gap in trust between officers and administrators runs deep, and this is some evidence that even recruits are exposed to the distrust from a very early stage in their careers. In some ways this would support Beauchamp’s conclusions, in that there are important exposures in academy training that shape officers’ views of policing. However, amending Beauchamp’s thesis in this post-hoc manner is speculative at best, because his reporting does not reflect this important bit of information.\n\r\rWhat’s striking about these themes taken together is the notable absence of the animating thesis for Beauchamp’s article, which is: “The purpose of the Dinkheller video…is to teach officers that any situation could escalate to violence. Cop killers lurk around every corner.” Dramatic language, but not language supported by officers’ words, either in the article (because they weren’t asked), or in my quick sample. Quite contrary to the article’s thesis that the Dinkheller video teaches officers that unexpected danger is around every corner, officers see the video as teaching them expected dangers are right in front of you. That is some valuable insight, and was entirely available to Beauchamp, had he bothered to ask.\nThe other obvious deficiency that these six officers expose in Beauchamp’s reporting is that there is no singular ideology. This should not be surprising. With at least 800,000 officers in the US, and 18,000 law enforcement agencies, ascribing a singular ideology is tenuous at best. Doing so contributes to visions of law enforcement officers as less than fully human, as robotic and featureless cogs in a unitary system. Anyone who has researched officers knows that’s an unfair conclusion. Even worse, in the context of reporting, it is an inaccurate one. One way to avoid that kind of caricature is to spend time - a lot of time - with the people on whom you report.\n\rDoing Better\rFormer officers and scholars, myself included, are valuable resources for insights about how officers view the world. The trap that Beauchamp fell into is assuming those insights are the same as officers’ own. This is a pernicious problem in journalism about police. Check your favorite paper and count how many times some version of “Police say…” is used. How many were followed with the views of 1) line officers, who were 2) not representing the department as a public information officer or spokesperson?\nDoing better means listening to more people. Not experts on people, but the people themselves. Doing better allows you to avoid misjudging the depth of an issue, and revealing variation you could not otherwise have accessed. I only made a handful of calls, and Beauchamp only spoke with “more than a dozen” sources, but the variety of interesting themes is already too complicated and interesting to reduce down to an “ideology of American policing” as claimed in the Vox piece. Variation is good, rough reductionism helps no one.\nJournalists and journalism generally, and Vox specifically, can do better. I enjoy the policy dives that Vox provides in all kinds of areas. Like many, I rely on their reportage to get an accurate picture of worlds I don’t otherwise have access to. How accurate would an article be titled “What Teachers Really Believe,” if we found out not a single teacher was used? I suspect some teacher’s might object, especially if their actual views were not represented, and they would be right to do so.\n\r","date":1594684800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594759436,"objectID":"d6e7e8a9259318df9227e0795cd0ca95","permalink":"https://ianadamsresearch.com/post/what-police-believe/what-police-believe/","publishdate":"2020-07-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/what-police-believe/what-police-believe/","section":"post","summary":"The article begins with promises of a “deep dive” but ends up misjudging the depth of the pool.

We want to know if varying the dinosaurs type and size in a vignette results in statistically significant differences in potential patrons willingness to visit. We have two types of dinosaurs, and they come in three sizes. Will our potential guests be more likely to purchase a vacation package dependent on the type and size of dinosaurs we advertise with?\nThere are multiple ways we could do this. For example, we could just type out each of the six vignette (2x3) and have those randomly display to respondents. However, some vignette designs have a lot more conditions to evaluate. Here, I’ll demonstrate a simple 2x3 vignette factorial design, but the method can easily be modified for larger designs. The survey platform Qualtrics makes this easy, using embedded data and the randomizer in survey flows.\nPlaceholder Descriptive Text\rFollowing months of research, we have determined that there are TWO types of dinosaurs (T-rex and Stegosaurus), and each dinosaur comes in three sizes (big, humongous, and ginormous). Lucky for us, this is a perfect opportunity to put a 2x3 factorial vignette design into play!\nFor now, let’s create a place holder question in the survey. Our vignette will be about dinosaurs, and we are interested in willingness to visit our new Dinocreations.\n\rBuilding the Randomizer\rNext we need to build a randomizer inside the survey flow. Once inside the survey flow, click the “add below” text inside the survey block, then click the “randomizer” tag.\nNow we want to add the type of information this randomizer will handle, in this case, “type” of dinosaur. Click “Add a new element here,” using the “embedded data” type, and assign “type” as the element name. Then assign a type of dinosaur, I chose “terrifying Tyrannasaurus Rex.” Then repeat this step, and assign a different type of dinosaur, in this case an “adorable Stegosaurus.” Finally, make sure you tell the randomizer to randomly present only 1 of these options. Click the “evenly present options” if you want there to be a randomized and equal chance for your survey respondents to see each choice (so here, a 1:2 chance, but for size, a 1:3 chance).\nNow we want to build another randomizer, this time to vary the size of the dinosaur in our vignette. Using the same steps as above, we will add a size randomizer that uses three elements of big, humongous, and ginormous, and then make sure only one of these options is presented.\nFor the final step in the survey flow, we want to make sure both randomizers are ABOVE the vignette question. This assures that the appropriate information is placed into our survey vignette question.\n\rBack to the vignette, and inserting piped text\rSave and close the survey flow interface. Now we need to use the “piped text” interface to get our vignette put together. We have decided to concentrate on customers who will be leaving on their honeymoon soon. The plain text in this box is text that EVERY survey respondent will see, while the SIZE and TYPE placeholders will need to be modified to import the embedded data we defined in the survey flow steps above.\nTo use the piped text funcionality, highlight SIZE, and then click the “piped text” tab directly above:\nThen, click the “embedded data” option, and type in “size” (without the quotation marks) and hit enter. Repeat this step for the TYPE placeholder, with the “type” embedded data. After you delete the placeholders, you should have something that looks like:\nNow, let’s see if our survey is working. Use the “preview” button at the top of the page. Check it a few times to make sure the randomization is working. Here, in two consecutive previews, I can already see the randomization is working!\nand\n\rConclusion\rAnalyzing the results is outside of the scope of this post, but there are plenty of guides for that. Now go forth and randomize your vignettes!\n\r","date":1590192000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590272368,"objectID":"b5b6312a88c7cbe8d73bffbf81a949f9","permalink":"https://ianadamsresearch.com/post/qualtrics/randomizing-vignettes-in-survey-research-with-qualtrics/","publishdate":"2020-05-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/qualtrics/randomizing-vignettes-in-survey-research-with-qualtrics/","section":"post","summary":"Sometimes in survey research, we want to present varying conditions in a short descriptive text, often called a vignette, and measure the effects of those conditions on an outcome of interest.","tags":["survey","vignette","qualtrics"],"title":"Randomizing Vignette Factorial Designs in Survey Research with Qualtrics","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":["R","website"],"content":"\r\rThis report was generated on 2020-12-30, as a demo of textclean from https://github.com/trinker/textclean#check-text\nThis is an R Markdown Notebook.

Design/methodology/approach Using data from a survey of law enforcement employees in a metropolitan police department, a full-service sheriff's department, and a state corrections agency located in the western United States (n = 1,921), we test the explanatory power of an emotional labor-based model of burnout. Findings Results partially confirm the lone prior study to examine civilian and sworn personnel. Sworn and civilian employees experience variant levels of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, though the underlying emotional labor correlates are significantly related to burnout for both groups. Further, we extend prior results by capturing multiple facets of burnout as well as contributing an emotional labor explanation for burnout, while controlling for individual demographic characteristics and agency type. Research limitations/implications Law enforcement agencies rely upon non-sworn employees to support their missions. The experience of non-sworn law enforcement personnel is under-researched in both the emotional labor and law enforcement organizational literature. Burnout is a phenomenon that has high costs for both employees and organizations, particularly in the law enforcement context. Investigating the emotional labor experience of employees is critical for practitioners who are tasked with effectively managing both groups. Originality/value One previous study has investigated the emotional labor of civilians in law enforcement and used community-level predictions for burnout. This study builds on those findings by capturing two facets of burnout rather than the lone gauge of burnout used in the previous study.

This study is the first to investigate the effect of emergency dispatch script protocols on workplace outcomes of burnout and turnover intention. Hypotheses: The study tests two related hypotheses: Greater script comfort among emergency dispatchers will be associated with decreased emotional exhaustion (Hl) and decreased turnover intention (H2). Methods: The study uses multivariate regression to establish baseline models of emotional exhaustion and turnover intention among respondents. Structural equation modeling is then used to explore the direct and mediated relationship between script discomfort and the two outcomes simultaneously. Results: Dispatchers who express more discomfort with script protocols express elevated levels of emotional exhaustion (Hl), but not turnover intention (H2), to a statistically significant degree. This multivariate regression result is validated in a structural equation model (SEM) which solves for both outcome variables simultaneously, and demonstrates the centrality of surface acting in the overall model of both emotional exhaustion and turnover intention. Conclusions: As script protocols continue to increase in use and complexity, emergency dispatch managers and administrators should be cognizant of potential increases in emotional exhaustion among employees. The overall increases documented in this study are small to moderate in size, but given the high baseline levels of burnout among emergency dispatch personnel, any increase is potentially damaging. This study found no significant increase in turnover intention, which was protected against through dispatchers' increased use of surface acting. However, we did not test for or rule out the potential negative outcomes of poorer physical and mental health, increased absenteeism, and increased substance abuse that have been documented in other emotional labor studies.","tags":[],"title":"Emotional Labor in Emergency Dispatch: Gauging Effects of Training Protocols","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sharon H.

However, unlike previous research, we examine administrative data on actual use-of-force and include emotional labor into the model to reveal Surface Acting as a positive and significant correlate to use-of-force, while depersonalization has no effect. Other positive and statistically-significant correlates to use-of-force include number of primary calls and perceived need for use-of-force. In contrast, sex, years of experience, and prior military experience do not explain variations in use-of-force, nor does perceived organizational support or serving in a line officer capacity. We conclude with suggestions for further research, including examining use-of-force as a workplace stressor and the potential for emotional suppression to alter officer interpretations of suspect behavior.","tags":[],"title":"It's not Depersonalization, It's Emotional Labor: Examining Surface Acting and Use-of-Force with evidence from the US","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ian T.

This is a largely unexamined but salient question in the use-of-force literature and is important given the ongoing public discourse regarding police use-of-force, community standards, and perceived gaps between the two. This study focuses on two main research questions: Are substantial portions of the public predisposed to disapprove of legally reasonable police use-of-force? If so, what are the principal correlates of those disapproving attitudes? We analyze responses (n = 20,781) to General Social Survey (GSS) questions from 1990 through 2018 entailing police use-of-force scenarios that are prima facie legally reasonable. We find a substantial proportion of GSS respondents have expressed their disapproval of legally reasonable, justifiable police uses-of-force over the entire period, and such disapproval has increased over time. Causes and policy implications of this misalignment are discussed.","tags":[],"title":"Assessing Public Perceptions of Police Use-of-Force: Legal Reasonableness and Community Standards","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sharon Mastracci","Ian Adams"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"ea46e4fd20ed450517a79435e9f15e6d","permalink":"https://ianadamsresearch.com/publication/2019-01-01_emotional_labour_in_/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-01-01_emotional_labour_in_/","section":"publication","summary":"The purpose of this paper is to explore emotional labour in the context of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) using word data from interviews of five NGO directors on their recruitment criteria when hiring staff.

We find evidence of emotional labour in NGOs: modelling behaviour for clients, serving as mentors to new staff members, maintaining boundaries between self and clients, suppressing panic in crisis, cognitive reframing, and compartmentalisation. We provide evidence of emotional labour in NGOs, which contributes to emotional labour theory by focusing solely on this important sector of public service.

Although the robustness of the organic food market is difficult to contest, many debate the extent to which U.S. organic policy outcomes adequately serve consumers and the organic agriculture producers they rely on. This paper engages the debate from the perspective of certified organic producers. Drawing on the results of a nationwide survey of USDA-certified producers, we first provide a snapshot of how producers assess the environmental, consumer, and market impacts of U.S. organic food policy. We then examine the extent to which organic producers’ policy impact perceptions are associated with their alignment with an “organic ethos”—understood as producers’ commitment to core organic principles and the organic movement. The paper highlights producers’ values as perceptual filters and cognitive mechanisms that help shape producers’ policy impacts perceptions, illustrating a contributing factor to the enduring nature of organic policy debates.","tags":[],"title":"How Values Shape Program Perceptions: The “Organic Ethos” and Producers’ Assessments of U.S. Organic Policy Impacts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sharon Mastracci","Ian Adams"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"cf021a2a04e51cfce9c5c9e2fd5d4572","permalink":"https://ianadamsresearch.com/publication/2019-01-01_is_emotional_labor_e/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-01-01_is_emotional_labor_e/","section":"publication","summary":"Emotional labor is the effort to express job-appropriate emotions and/or suppress inappropriate emotions. The effort manifests in interpersonal interactions, whether face to face or voice to voice, and can increase stress and burnout. Most research in emotional labor is based on North American samples. Could public servants in different cultures experience emotional labor differently? We test the provocative hypothesis that emotional labor is less stressful for people in collectivist cultures, due to the predominance of harmony and interdependence in such cultures. Our results confirm that emotional labor via surface acting leads to burnout to a lesser degree for respondents in collectivist cultures compared with individualistic cultures. Emotional labor via deep acting actually lowers burnout in collectivist cultures. We also find that emotional labor theories based on North American studies may be used in Eastern contexts, and that public servants in collectivist cultures are more responsive to display rules compared with those in individualist cultures.","tags":[],"title":"Is Emotional Labor Easier in Collectivist or Individualist Cultures?

Analyzing large numbers of police free-text responses provides more nuanced understanding of police perceptions of the public. Officers' attention to professionalism guards against de-policing, while attention to perceived unfair criticism increases it. The public's integrity has a stronger effect on propensity to de-police than the public's knowledge about police work.The aims of this paper are twofold. First, the introduction and justification of machine-learning-based structural topic modeling (STM) in a policing context. STM provides a flexible platform for leveraging open-ended survey questions (Roberts, Stewart, \u0026 Tingley, 2014). Despite advances in other fields, to date, the method has received little attention in the criminology (and adjacent) literature, and to our knowledge, this paper is the first policing study to use STM methods. The second aim is to establish hypothesis validity for the STM technique. This goal is accomplished by testing the association between the derived structural topics and officers' general motivation regarding proactivity (or its absence – de-policing).","tags":[],"title":"The rhetoric of de-policing: Evaluating open-ended survey responses from police officers with machine learning-based structural topic modeling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sharon H.

From a twentieth-century welfare state, to New Public Management reforms, to New Labour and its reliance on nonprofits, to the Brexit era, the nation has sought one system after another as a means to provide efficient, effective services in a way that resonates with a difficult-to-satisfy populace. The most durable inheritance from the market-based reforms that began in the 1980s has been the perceptual switch from citizen to customer. The twenty-first century-public servant performs within a hybrid form of neoliberal ideology and consumerist discourse that manifests itself through managerialism. Citizens see themselves as consumers and government as seller. This perception may account for the lack of a relationship between authentically engaging in emotional labor and job outcomes. Perhaps there is less identity with the job itself than would be the case if the citizen–state encounter were more meaningful than a simple customer-seller exchange.","tags":[],"title":"The UK","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sharon H.

International policy is administered by public servants, which in this context are international civil servants, whose work-life is governed by unique display rules. Managing the demands of those rules requires emotional labor, and in order to understand how it is experienced by international civil servants, an expanded comparative public administration must delve into both the home cultures of civil servants and the meta-culture of international public administration. “Boundary spanning” employees must balance national and subnational differences in both display rules and emotive demands. Yet, theories of emotional labor were primarily crafted within Western cultures, and scholarship has been slow to explore how the framework of emotional labor may differ around the globe.

Here we argue that public servants risk becoming alienated due to the unsupported emotional labor demands of their jobs. Alienated public servants can, in turn, alienate citizens from their government via emotional contagion, and because targets of emotional labor can detect inauthentic surface acting, they will distrust encounters with government as a result. Human resource management practices and organizational structures can mitigate or exacerbate this effect. The problem, though, is that public service is rooted in scientific management, which reifies top-down hierarchy, increasing the likelihood of alienation through its commitment to the bureaucratic form. By extending emotional labor theory to self-estrangement and fellow-beings estrangement, our argument incorporates all four of Marx’s dimensions of alienation, including commodity fetishism, where people are things and feelings qua feelings are part of an overall public service delivery package.","tags":[],"title":"“That’s What the Money’s for”: Alienation and Emotional Labor in Public Service","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ian T.

To date, the BWC policy narrative in the United States frames the technology as a method to increase transparency in police–community interactions and build legitimacy. However, irrespective of how noble the original intent, technologies tend to morph from beneficence to overt control in the absence of countervailing friction. This article critiques the increased transparency brought about by BWCs to broadly explore the impact of increased exposure on victims, and concludes by proposing ethical policy principles to limit the harms the new technology could pose to vulnerable victims of domestic and sexual violence.","tags":[],"title":"Visibility is a Trap: The Ethics of Police Body-Worn Cameras and Control","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"\r\r“That’s the problem with police, you don’t show enough feeling,” she said. “You don’t feel enough.” She’s right, of course.\nA drowning in a desert town with no lakes. My partner jumped into the canal and pushed the huge man to the bank. I struggled and pulled, he pushed and slipped, both of us wet and covered with mud, neither of us feeling the cold water. Our new officer arrived and jumped into the scene, pushing on the man’s chest while I hovered over his face, trying to see inside his mouth. His wife, hands on my shoulders, screaming in my ear, screaming no. I couldn’t feel her breath on my neck, her tears on my head. Finally, my partner says to stop, just stop. I looked down and saw my pants were covered in the man’s blood, which had poured from the bullet hole in his temple. I couldn’t feel the wet blood soaking through my pants. She’s right, of course, I couldn’t feel enough.\nA gunshot in the basement of a home. As I made my way down the stairs, the air was filled with a haze. A man, missing his face, and a rifle sitting in a lake of blood on the bed. Three walls covered with meat. The mewling, writhing figure unable to speak, but clearly letting me know the horror, the pain he was feeling. A few inches of jaw, glued to the carpet, the stubble of beard visible from the inside. The home now filled with explosive gas, a mother unaware. A mother begging us to just let her son die. As I grabbed the woman by the arm, I couldn’t feel her brittle, old bones under my grip. I couldn’t smell the gas, couldn’t gag as I pulled the jaw from the carpet; I couldn’t find it inside me to feel the horror. She’s right, of course, I couldn’t feel enough.\nA mother, worn by the chemotherapy, held hostage. A son, a mind broken by drugs and now holding mom hostage until a girlfriend returns.

I can’t feel my friend get cut. I can’t feel my gun, screwed into the temple of a man who’s so close to having a mind broken by a bullet. “I’ve got the knife,” the officer behind me yells. I can’t feel the relief. She’s right, of course, I couldn’t feel enough.\nA breathing problem, a medical call, leave it for the medics. But I’m here, and this lady isn’t breathing, won’t breathe again. I can’t feel her granddaughter behind me, watching me place shock pads on grandma’s chest, watching me push helplessly on grandma as the machine tells me to push harder. Later now, the medics gone. As her husband pulls me into a hug, I can’t feel his heart breaking inside. Her husband has to say goodbye, and I go to her first. I never knew her, but she wouldn’t want to be seen like this, not for a goodbye. I pull a breathing tube from her throat, I can’t feel the bulb catch on her teeth, her stiffening jaw fighting this release. I pull on the bone needles screwed into her shins, I can’t feel how diabetes has scarred her lower legs. I wipe the blood from her nose and mouth, I can’t feel how cold the blood already is. She’s right, of course, I couldn’t feel enough.\nA naked monster, celebrating his first day outside of prison with a cocktail of street drugs and liquor, kicking in the door. A boy, just eight, standing behind the door, holding a bat to protect his four-year-old sister from the monster outside. I can’t feel their panic, I don’t know they stand just feet from where the monster and I fight. I can’t feel his fingernails, carving deep and bloody into my arm. I can’t feel the burning as sweat, blood, and mace spray mix into the bloody cuts. He can’t feel the pain, he’s well beyond feeling. As he breaks the porch, breaks the door, breaks my skin, breaks the quiet peace of the neighborhood, I can’t feel his hair in both my hands, pulling him back from the sidewalk where he slams his head. Even today, I can’t feel those five long scars on my arm. She’s right, of course, I couldn’t feel enough.\nA stolen car, a property crime. A man, too much time inside bars, reaching for the gun wrapped in a white t-shirt, cleaner than any of his other clothing. I can’t feel his hands around my waist as we fight, as we drag him from the car. I can’t feel the cars driving by us as I punch. His girlfriend screams, but I can’t feel her fear. As I continue to punch, five, six, seven hits, why won’t he stop? My wrist breaks, but I can’t feel that right now. “I’ll give you this,” he says later as we laugh together, “you boys know how to get down. I ain’t never been punched like that.” I can’t feel this admiration, can’t feel how sometimes the only one who understands is the guy you have to fight on the other side of the game. Months later, putting together another Lego set for my son. He can’t feel the bone inside my wrist give too much, the sharp pain that makes me gasp. I can’t feel the wrist, the back, the shoulder that has given too much. She’s right, of course, I couldn’t feel enough.\nAnother friend, another loss. Years ago now, he pulled that girl out of the cold creek, did he feel how her six-year-old body was too heavy, too water-soaked?

He’d felt enough; he must’ve had enough.\n","date":1452643200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1452643200,"objectID":"345e4ecdf16c4d71fe321c81e7cd20c9","permalink":"https://ianadamsresearch.com/post/tyranny-of-feeling/tyranny-of-feeling/","publishdate":"2016-01-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/tyranny-of-feeling/tyranny-of-feeling/","section":"post","summary":"“That’s the problem with police, you don’t show enough feeling,” she said. “You don’t feel enough.” She’s right, of course.\nA drowning in a desert town with no lakes.","tags":["police","trauma"],"title":"The Tyranny of Feeling","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\r\rI was dispatched on a gunshot. The 65-year-old mother reported her son had just shot himself. She was refusing to provide CPR or go see if he was okay. I was only a couple blocks away. My best friend and I arrived simultaneously and contacted the complainant at the back door. She was in a thin nightgown and completely calm. She said, “He’s down there,” pointing downstairs.\nAs we made our way down, I walked through a haze in the air, thick enough that it was forming waves in the air. I didn’t take immediate conscious notice of it, but both my partner and I commented on a strong smell in the air. Although I must have known better, I said that it must be gunpowder, making the connection with the call description of a gunshot.\nAs we got to the bottom of the stairs, I stopped at the sound of horrible moaning coming from a back bedroom. I made eye contact with Adam. “You ready?” He nodded, and we moved in slowly.\nThe bedroom was tucked off a small hallway that intersected with the main downstairs hallway. I saw the blood before entering. Three walls of the room were covered in goo. I couldn’t see the victim, but I could hear him. I saw a rifle laying on the bed, in a literal pool of blood. I forced myself to take a few more steps through the door. Training takes over, “Don’t stop in the fatal funnel.”\nAs I came through the door, I saw him to my left. He was down on all fours, rocking back and forth. The first detail I noticed was his very red shirt. I saw the bottom hem of the shirt was white, it was just a normal white t-shirt.\n“Buddy, we’ve got help coming, just stay there.” I’m not sure what you’re supposed to say. He raised his face to me. It was completely cut in half, the cheek flaps waving back and forth. He had stuck a rifle under his chin, and when he stretched to reach the trigger, his head tipped back. The bullet entered the soft jaw, crossing the hard palate, and left at the top of his nose. There was nothing left but cheeks and eyes.\nI’ll never forget the moaning. On all fours, he rocked back and forth, shaking his head back and forth and just moaning. The sound is still with me. As he shook his head, the two flaps of cheek kept swinging back and forth, opening and closing, just like the fucking Predator. I swear, if that guy had stood up and walked towards me, I would’ve shot him.\nThe first few medics arrived. They had been told by dispatch that the subject was “echo” (obviously deceased), and hesitated until I pointed out that they needed to get on this one, and get on it now. They started to cut off his red shirt. I told dispatch to get the bird going now. She said, “You want them on standby?” She was trying to help me, as really only medics are supposed to tell the air medics to fly. “No, tell them to fly now, this one’s going.”\nMy sergeant was the third to arrive. When he got downstairs, he took a deep breath, “What’s that smell?”\n“Gunpowder, sarge.”\n“Nah, that’s not gunpowder.” He breathed a few deep nasal breaths. “That’s…like propane or something.”\nThe medics stopped and inhaled. “Fuck.” Silence took over, and we all hear at the same time what had been covered up by horrible moaning. In the wall, behind where the man shot himself, was a bullet hole. Out of the hole came a hissing sound. The bullet had cut through the natural gas main that fed the house from the outside meter.\nFor the first time in my career, I saw firefighters panic. “Get out get out get out” three of them yelling at the same time. I got on the radio and called “No flames” and told everyone to clear. I saw for the first time what the “waves of haze” I had noticed earlier were. It was natural gas which had filled up the bottom floor of the house, filled it up so much that the “top” of the gas lake was over my eyes, at about six feet deep.\nThe medics grabbed the guy and ran upstairs. I quickly cleared the downstairs, thinking the guy might have small kids in the rooms or something. They were clear. I came upstairs and found Adam sitting calmly in the sitting room with the victim’s mother. I stopped, unable to understand what he was doing still in the house.\n“Adam, get her out of here!” I wasn’t yelling yet, but I was angry. I had stayed behind for two minutes in a situation that was probably going to kill me, and he had stayed in the fucking house talking with mom?\nHe looked at me, confused. “Adam, get her the fuck out of this house,” I was yelling now. The mother stood up, saying she needed shoes. I grabbed her, probably too hard on the arm, she was old. I pushed her through the door. “Get the fuck out and do it now.” I could feel myself losing a bit of control. I’ve never, never lost control.\nAdam didn’t understand. He had turned his radio down so he could sit with the mom and not have her hear the awful details that would likely be on the radio. He didn’t hear me give out the evacuate order. He still didn’t understand, but he trusted me, or was scared by my reaction, I’m not sure. He stepped between me and the mom, who was still trying to get inside. He did what had to be done, but he did it gently, at least. I couldn’t manage that.\nI went back in with some haz-mat guys ten minutes later. The horror of the room was more noticeable this time. I saw the little bone and teeth chips were stuck in the soles of my boot. I saw that huge glops of human goo were dripping down the walls. I got to the clean wall, the only wall without spackled meat all over it. It was the wall he had faced when he pulled the trigger. I looked down and saw his chin, laying on the carpet at my feet.\n“Dispatch, check with the hospital, see if they want this tissue.” I couldn’t believe I was even asking. The dude was going to die, I knew it, everyone knew it, right?\n“That’s affirm, they want it delivered.”\n“Copy.” How…the…fuck. My sergeant, one of my best friends, offered to do it. “Nah sarge, fuck it, I’ll get it.” I knew I was already gonna feel this one, no need for anyone else to take more of a hit on this. I grabbed a bio sack from one of the firefighters and went upstairs to the freezer. I put a layer of ice inside and went back to the chin.\nYou know how sometimes it’s the false expectations that get you? I went to pick up the chin. I knew it would be hard, like chins are. When I grabbed it, though, it felt like unset jello. Of course it did, there was no bone there, it was literally just the chin. It had fallen goo side down, and stuck to the carpet fibers as it dried over the previous thirty or so minutes. I had to tug at, and when it released it landed in my palm, gooey side up. I could see where his whiskers poked out…from the inside. Whoever thought that there was another end to each of our chin whiskers?\nI gave the bad to a firefighter to run it to the hospital. It didn’t matter; I knew he was dead. Or going to be soon enough.\nI learned later that he was 45 years old. At age 35, he got a degenerative brain disease, Huntington’s or something. It took him pretty quick, leaving him with the reasoning skills of an eight-year-old. His mother begged us on the front grass, after I probably bruised her arm, just to let him die. Where’s the DNR? I asked. There wasn’t one.\nHe died two hours after shooting himself. They pumped blood bag after blood bag into him, but it all just came out his massive facial wounds.\nThe ME called me that night, asked, “So, that was a weird one huh?” Fucking ME’s.\n“What’ya need man?” I asked him.\n“You notice anything strange in there?” he asked.\n“…nope. Just another fucking suicide.”\n“Yeah, figured. Alright, see you on the next one,” he said.\n“Yup.”\n","date":1371081600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1371081600,"objectID":"e45e120a09dd7f631764e218c7875413","permalink":"https://ianadamsresearch.com/post/it-will-have-blood/it-will-have-blood/","publishdate":"2013-06-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/it-will-have-blood/it-will-have-blood/","section":"post","summary":"I was dispatched on a gunshot.
