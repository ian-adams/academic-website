abstract: The initial interaction between rape victims and police can affect how these
  cases progress through the criminal justice system. In one US state capitol, the
  police agency determined its initial response to rape victims was less effective
  than desired. Victim retention was low, and officer written reports were found to
  endorse negative stereotypes about rape victims. A four-hour training highlighting
  trauma-informed and victim-supportive police response was developed and implemented,
  and all agency officers were trained (n=~600). Compared to the six months before
  training, victim retention improved by 32% in the post-training period. Written
  reports by officers also improved, showcasing victim-supportive language and improving
  officers' focus on victim services. The increase in victim retention is a positive
  outcome for a relatively short training intervention. This chapter concludes that
  intensive, evidence-based training programs that connect victim trauma response
  to police trauma response may significantly improve police response to rape victims
  during initial contact.
summary: Police in a major U.S. city found that rape victims were frequently dropping
  out of investigations, partly because officers' initial responses and report writing
  reflected harmful stereotypes about sexual assault victims. After implementing a
  four-hour trauma-informed training program for all 600 officers, victim participation
  in investigations increased by 32% and officers began using more supportive language
  in their reports. This research demonstrates that relatively brief, specialized
  training can significantly improve how police respond to sexual assault cases, potentially
  leading to better outcomes for victims and more effective investigations.

## Summary

Police in a major U.S. city found that rape victims were frequently dropping out of investigations, partly because officers' initial responses and report writing reflected harmful stereotypes about sexual assault victims. After implementing a four-hour trauma-informed training program for all 600 officers, victim participation in investigations increased by 32% and officers began using more supportive language in their reports. This research demonstrates that relatively brief, specialized training can significantly improve how police respond to sexual assault cases, potentially leading to better outcomes for victims and more effective investigations.

## Abstract

The initial interaction between rape victims and police can affect how these cases progress through the criminal justice system. In one US state capitol, the police agency determined its initial response to rape victims was less effective than desired. Victim retention was low, and officer written reports were found to endorse negative stereotypes about rape victims. A four-hour training highlighting trauma-informed and victim-supportive police response was developed and implemented, and all agency officers were trained (n=~600). Compared to the six months before training, victim retention improved by 32% in the post-training period. Written reports by officers also improved, showcasing victim-supportive language and improving officers' focus on victim services. The increase in victim retention is a positive outcome for a relatively short training intervention. This chapter concludes that intensive, evidence-based training programs that connect victim trauma response to police trauma response may significantly improve police response to rape victims during initial contact.
