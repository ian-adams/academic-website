abstract: Courts regularly rely on scientific expert testimony in police use-of-force
  cases, and the Force Science Institute (FSI)—a private, for-profit entity—has emerged
  as an important source of purportedly scientific principles shaping police training,
  policies, and legal outcomes. Its “peer-reviewed” corpus is presented as scientifically
  authoritative and feeds into “Force Science Analyst” certification and expert consulting.
  Employing bibliometric analysis and three validated measures of scientific reliability,
  we assess a recent volume ( Force Science ) representing FSI’s claimed knowledge
  for scientific reliability. Contrary to FSI’s assertions, our findings show its
  published materials fail to meet the scientific rigor demanded by the Daubert standard,
  which governs the admissibility of scientific evidence in U.S. courts. These results
  highlight the need for caution and critical scrutiny of such evidence, and suggest
  that reliance on Force Science in legal proceedings, training programs, and policing
  policies risks introducing unverified concepts into high-stakes decision-making
  contexts.
summary: Researchers examined the scientific quality of work produced by the Force
  Science Institute, a private company that provides expert testimony and training
  materials used in police use-of-force cases, and found that their research fails
  to meet basic scientific standards required for court evidence. Despite being presented
  as authoritative science, Force Science materials lack the reliability and rigor
  that courts, police departments, and training programs should demand when making
  critical decisions about police use of force. This matters because unreliable "science"
  is currently being used to influence legal cases, officer training, and department
  policies that determine when and how police use force against civilians.

## Summary

Researchers examined the scientific quality of work produced by the Force Science Institute, a private company that provides expert testimony and training materials used in police use-of-force cases, and found that their research fails to meet basic scientific standards required for court evidence. Despite being presented as authoritative science, Force Science materials lack the reliability and rigor that courts, police departments, and training programs should demand when making critical decisions about police use of force. This matters because unreliable "science" is currently being used to influence legal cases, officer training, and department policies that determine when and how police use force against civilians.
