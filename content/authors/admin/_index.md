I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at the University of Utah. I study public administration, policing, and emotional labor theory. I am particularly interested in the consequences of work-place surveillance on front-line public employees. That line of research has been strongly motivated by the [example of body-worn cameras in policing](https://scholars.org/contribution/need-nuanced-research-uses-and-misuses-body-worn-police-cameras).

I am a cross-disciplinary scholar, and strive to produce original research with practical value. My work improves the lives of the men and women of law enforcement and the communities they serve. I have been honored to be recognized as a 2018 American Society of Public Administration Foundersâ€™ Fellow, and a 2020 doctoral fellow of the Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences. 

My current CV can be found in the menu above, or the direct link below. Please use the Google Scholar, ResearchGate, or CV options (the icons under my picture will take you directly there!) to find links to publications and other materials. I'm always happy to provide a full-text copy of any research as well, just email me!
