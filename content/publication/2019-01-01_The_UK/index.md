abstract = "The story of postwar government in the UK is a story of serial reform. From a twentieth-century welfare state, to New Public Management reforms, to New Labour and its reliance on nonprofits, to the Brexit era, the nation has sought one system after another as a means to provide efficient, effective services in a way that resonates with a difficult-to-satisfy populace. The most durable inheritance from the market-based reforms that began in the 1980s has been the perceptual switch from citizen to customer. The twenty-first century-public servant performs within a hybrid form of neoliberal ideology and consumerist discourse that manifests itself through managerialism. Citizens see themselves as consumers and government as seller. This perception may account for the lack of a relationship between authentically engaging in emotional labor and job outcomes. Perhaps there is less identity with the job itself than would be the case if the citizenâ€“state encounter were more meaningful than a simple customer-seller exchange."
