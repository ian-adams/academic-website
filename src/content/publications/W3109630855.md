abstract: 'Law enforcement agencies in the United States take on a wide variety of
  organisational structures, but all rely upon the non-sworn employees who support
  the agencies'' missions. The experiences of non-sworn law enforcement personnel
  are hardly remarked upon in both the emotional labor and criminal justice literature,
  despite accounting for up to 46% of employees in law enforcement agencies AU: Citations

  from the Abstract. Please check and confirm. This chapter aims to identify and contrast
  characteristics of emotional labor in both sworn and civilian employees in a large
  US corrections department.Drawing on quantitative data (n = 934) collected from
  an extensive survey project conducted in August 2018, we center emotional labor
  at its intersection with job function. Results show that while the accepted framework
  of emotional labor holds across job function, the established model of emotional
  labor and burnout does not adequately describe the experiences of the differing
  subgroups. Comparing and contrasting the emotional labor experience of employees
  who work alongside each other, but whose work lives have different demands, outcomes,
  and experiences, is critical for criminal justice administrators who are tasked
  with effectively managing both groups. The chapter concludes with a set of learning
  objectives that highlight the varying paths to burnout for both sworn and civilian
  employees.'
summary: This study examined how the emotional demands of police work affect both
  sworn officers and civilian employees (who make up nearly half of law enforcement
  agency staff) in a large corrections department. Survey data from 934 employees
  revealed that while both groups experience emotional stress from their jobs, they
  burn out in different ways and for different reasons. Understanding these differences
  is crucial for police administrators because current management approaches may not
  effectively address the distinct needs of civilian staff, who are essential to department
  operations but often overlooked in research and policy.

## Summary

This study examined how the emotional demands of police work affect both sworn officers and civilian employees (who make up nearly half of law enforcement agency staff) in a large corrections department. Survey data from 934 employees revealed that while both groups experience emotional stress from their jobs, they burn out in different ways and for different reasons. Understanding these differences is crucial for police administrators because current management approaches may not effectively address the distinct needs of civilian staff, who are essential to department operations but often overlooked in research and policy.
