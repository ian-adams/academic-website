abstract: Most use-of-force policies utilized by U.S. police agencies make fundamental
  ordinal assumptions about officers’ force responses to subject resistance. These
  policies consist of varying levels of force and resistance along an ordinally ranked
  continuum of severity. We empirically tested the ordinal assumptions that are ubiquitous
  to police use-of-force continua within the United States using 1 year’s use-of-force
  data from a municipal police department. Applying a quantitative technique known
  as categorical regression with optimal scaling, we found the assumptions of ordinality
  within the studied department’s use-of-force continuum (which is similar to many
  police use-of-force continua within the United States) are not met. Specifying physical
  force as a “lower” force option than less-lethal tools is associated with increased
  officer injury and decreased subject injury. Our findings call into question use-of-force
  continua featuring ordinal rankings for varying categories of less-lethal force.
summary: Police departments typically organize their use-of-force policies as a ladder
  where officers are expected to escalate from "lower" physical force (like strikes
  or takedowns) to "higher" technological tools (like tasers), but new research analyzing
  a year of police force incidents found this ranking doesn't match reality. When
  physical force was treated as a lesser option than electronic weapons, officers
  got injured more often while suspects got injured less, suggesting the traditional
  force hierarchy may be backwards. These findings challenge how police departments
  train officers and structure their policies about when and how to use different
  types of force.

## Summary

Police departments typically organize their use-of-force policies as a ladder where officers are expected to escalate from "lower" physical force (like strikes or takedowns) to "higher" technological tools (like tasers), but new research analyzing a year of police force incidents found this ranking doesn't match reality. When physical force was treated as a lesser option than electronic weapons, officers got injured more often while suspects got injured less, suggesting the traditional force hierarchy may be backwards. These findings challenge how police departments train officers and structure their policies about when and how to use different types of force.
