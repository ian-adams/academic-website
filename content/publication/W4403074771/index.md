abstract: Abstract Objectives This study examines the potential of artificial intelligence
  (AI) to reduce the time police officers spend writing reports, a task that consumes
  a significant portion of their workday. Methods In a pre-registered randomized controlled
  trial, we test this claim within the patrol division of a medium-sized police department
  ( n = 85) at the individual report level ( n = 755). Analyses utilize mixed-effects
  regression accounting for the nested structure of report-writing. Results AI assistance
  did not significantly affect the duration of writing police reports. Alternative
  specifications beyond those specified in the pre-registration, including a difference-in-differences
  approach observing report duration over a full year ( n = 6084), confirm the null
  findings are robust. Conclusions Our findings contradict marketing expectations
  for the effect of this technology, suggesting no time savings in report-writing
  can be expected when using AI-assisted report-writing. Several other potential effects
  remain possible and untested.
summary: A rigorous experiment with 85 police officers found that artificial intelligence
  tools did not reduce the time officers spent writing reports, despite industry claims
  that AI would speed up this time-consuming task. This matters because police departments
  are increasingly investing in AI technologies with the expectation they will free
  up officers for patrol duties, but this study suggests those promised efficiency
  gains may not materialize. The findings challenge assumptions about AI's immediate
  practical benefits in policing and suggest departments should be cautious about
  expecting quick returns on AI investments.

## Summary

A rigorous experiment with 85 police officers found that artificial intelligence tools did not reduce the time officers spent writing reports, despite industry claims that AI would speed up this time-consuming task. This matters because police departments are increasingly investing in AI technologies with the expectation they will free up officers for patrol duties, but this study suggests those promised efficiency gains may not materialize. The findings challenge assumptions about AI's immediate practical benefits in policing and suggest departments should be cautious about expecting quick returns on AI investments.
