summary: A 2018 study claimed that police killings of unarmed Black Americans harm
  the mental health of Black people living in the same state, but a new analysis found
  this conclusion was based on flawed statistical methods. When researchers corrected
  these problems and removed the influence of a tiny number of unusual survey responses
  (less than 1% of the data), the original finding disappeared entirely. This matters
  because it challenges a widely-cited piece of evidence about how police violence
  affects Black communities and highlights how sensitive some research conclusions
  can be to statistical choices.

## Summary

A 2018 study claimed that police killings of unarmed Black Americans harm the mental health of Black people living in the same state, but a new analysis found this conclusion was based on flawed statistical methods. When researchers corrected these problems and removed the influence of a tiny number of unusual survey responses (less than 1% of the data), the original finding disappeared entirely. This matters because it challenges a widely-cited piece of evidence about how police violence affects Black communities and highlights how sensitive some research conclusions can be to statistical choices.

## Abstract

This analysis reproduces Bor, et al.âs (2018) seminal study of the effect of police killings of unarmed Black Americans on the mental health of Black communities. Using BRFSS data, a national repeated cross-sectional survey, Bor, et al. found these police killings had significant negative effects on Black Americansâ mental health at the state-month level. Re-analysis found that its unadjusted results, which were not reported in the study, were null. Second, the studyâs reported significant population average exposure effect was a mechanical artifact of a weighting process that confounded exposure and outcome. Third, this significance was hypersensitive: it arose from the inclusion of 22 highly weighted respondents, comprising 0.02% of the sample (N=103,710). Fourth, the direction of this finding was also hypersensitive; removing 340 heavily-weighted observations (0.3% of the sample) reversed the outcome direction, producing an (insignificant) estimate that police killings of unarmed Black people improved Black Americansâ mental health. Fifth, correcting a week-day fixed effect that the original model specified but mistakenly calculated as a day-of-the-month fixed effect exacerbated these hypersensitivities (insignificance: n=10, 0.01%; direction: n= 315, 0.3%). Sixth, the studyâs causal model prioritized a media market mechanism that created exposure spillover (i.e., Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption) violations. The studyâs null unadjusted results, its significance arising only from the confounding effects of weighting, the hypersensitivity of significance to a small number of extreme weights, and a causal model that violates necessary assumptions cast doubt on the robustness of the original findings.
