abstract: Abstract We examine the factors influencing police response times, with
  a particular focus on staffing levels, calls for service (CFS), and proactive police
  work. We estimate Bayesian Holt-Winters state-space models for each CFS priority
  level. Using a novel dataset that combines data from the Salt Lake City Police Department's
  staffing and Computer-Aided Dispatch (CAD) systems at the daily level over seven
  years, we estimate the effects that staffing, overtime, call volume, and the level
  of proactive work (e.g., traffic stops, pedestrian stops, business checks) have
  on police response times. Our findings indicate that the impact of staffing on response
  times is significantly greater than that of other independent variables in the models.
  Furthermore, improvements in response times for higher-priority (i.e., more serious)
  CFS have a lower elasticity response to increases in staffing levels. As police
  agencies face increasingly complex challenges, the empirical evidence presented
  herein serves as a cornerstone for making informed decisions in the intricate balancing
  act of resources, officer well-being, and public safety priorities.
summary: Researchers analyzed seven years of police data from Salt Lake City to determine
  what factors most affect how quickly officers respond to emergency calls, finding
  that having enough officers on duty matters far more than other factors like call
  volume or proactive policing activities. The study reveals that while adding more
  officers improves response times across all types of calls, the biggest improvements
  occur for lower-priority incidents rather than the most serious emergencies. This
  evidence provides police departments with concrete data to support staffing decisions
  and helps explain why understaffed departments struggle to maintain quick response
  times even when they reduce other activities.

## Summary

Researchers analyzed seven years of police data from Salt Lake City to determine what factors most affect how quickly officers respond to emergency calls, finding that having enough officers on duty matters far more than other factors like call volume or proactive policing activities. The study reveals that while adding more officers improves response times across all types of calls, the biggest improvements occur for lower-priority incidents rather than the most serious emergencies. This evidence provides police departments with concrete data to support staffing decisions and helps explain why understaffed departments struggle to maintain quick response times even when they reduce other activities.
