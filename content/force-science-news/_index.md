This page automatically tracks news, research, and developments related to the [Force Science Institute (FSI)](https://www.forcescience.com/), a private company that produces research on police use-of-force. The feed surfaces journalistic coverage, legal proceedings, academic critiques, and policy developments.

**About Force Science Institute:** FSI trains and certifies "Force Science Analysts" who frequently testify as expert witnesses in criminal and civil cases involving police shootings. FSI's research and concepts (such as "action beats reaction," "inattentional blindness," and "slip and capture") shape jury deliberations, prosecutorial decisions, and police training curricula. The organization's methodology has been criticized by academic experts and the Department of Justice.
