abstract: Abstract Does the implementation of external oversight in policing improve
  public perceptions of police legitimacy? Civilian review boards (CRBs) are frequently
  promoted as mechanisms to enhance the legitimacy of police agencies by providing
  independent oversight. Despite public support for CRBs, their adoption and effectiveness
  remain limited, raising concerns about their actual impact on procedural fairness
  and police legitimacy. This study assesses the role of CRBs in shaping public perceptions
  by examining various decision-making scenarios involving police chiefs and CRBs.
  Using a survey experiment fielded to 2,503 respondents, we investigate whether CRBs
  enhance legitimacy when they either coincide with or conflict with police chiefs’
  determinations in cases of officer misconduct. Our findings suggest that while CRBs
  may enhance perceptions of procedural fairness for some, particularly those with
  negative views of police, their involvement does not generally increase legitimacy.
  In fact, when CRBs conflict with police chiefs, they may diminish public trust in
  both policing and civilian oversight and further entrench politically polarized
  attitudes towards policing. These results provide empirical evidence to support
  concerns that CRBs might not fulfill their intended role in enhancing police legitimacy,
  especially in cases of institutional disagreement.
summary: A new study examining civilian review boards—independent panels that investigate
  police misconduct—found these oversight bodies don't actually improve the public's
  trust in police as intended. While people with already negative views of police
  saw some benefit from civilian oversight, the boards generally failed to boost police
  legitimacy, and when they disagreed with police chiefs' decisions, public trust
  in both police and the oversight system actually decreased. These findings suggest
  that civilian review boards, despite widespread public support for the concept,
  may not be the effective solution to police accountability problems that many communities
  hope they will be.

## Summary

A new study examining civilian review boards—independent panels that investigate police misconduct—found these oversight bodies don't actually improve the public's trust in police as intended. While people with already negative views of police saw some benefit from civilian oversight, the boards generally failed to boost police legitimacy, and when they disagreed with police chiefs' decisions, public trust in both police and the oversight system actually decreased. These findings suggest that civilian review boards, despite widespread public support for the concept, may not be the effective solution to police accountability problems that many communities hope they will be.
